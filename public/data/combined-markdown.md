Ich zum Beispiel gehöre dem kongolesischen Luba-Volk an. Da wird viel gesungen, da kann ein Erzähler die gleiche Geschichte 30-mal vortragen, aber jedes Mal kommt etwas Neues heraus. So ist es auch, wenn ich heute meine Texte singe, schreie, rappe: Sie bekommen jedes Mal einen neuen Aspekt.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Characters\5 Stages Of Grief.md

A cyborg with 5 exo skeletons that add to the body. Only Combined they are like a gundam the are grief.

5 songs is all we need.
5 interlockable body parts

Mulholland Drive's 5 Stages of Grief as shown through its characters: 

Denial - Rita 
When something terrible happens, the world suddenly appears meaningless and overwhelming. So we may cling to a false, preferable reality, and avoid any reminders of the truth. When we hear that a loved one died, we might hold on to hope that maybe they just identified the wrong person, or through some unlikely event, our loved one actually made it out okay. 

Anger - Adam 
When we can no longer deny our situation, we may become enraged, as if something incredibly unfair has just happened to us we’re left to wonder what we did to deserve it. Anger is, in a way, a kind of strength that can give the illusion of structure to the hollowness of loss. 

Bargaining - Betty 
Hoping we can avoid grief, a period of bargaining may occur, taking the form of an emotional truce. All of our “What ifs” and “If onlys” remind us of our faults and what we could have done differently. A negotiation for a better outcome is often made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. We might try and create a better version of ourselves, worthy of a happier ending. 

Depression - Diane 
Eventually, our attention circles back to the here and now. Finally recognizing our situation, we may fall into despair. We become silent, reclusive and spend most of our time in a fog of intense sadness. 

Acceptance - Cowboy 
In this final stage, we embrace the inevitable future, or tragic event. We accept that our loved one is physically gone and recognize that this new reality is permanent. We are able, in some way, to move on. Of course in this film… well, this last part doesn’t really happen… “Not Acceptance” - The Bum

# Backstory

There is an imaginary story, that of the the human pope identity, which only exists in the mind of the avatar. it's bound to the "game" univers.

Es gibt ebenfalls, die variante der Katze, die den Pabst spielt. 

Beim Schreiben, ist das Problem, dass beide verworren bleiben sollten. Also faktisch fast wie in Parallel Universen sich einander bedingen, jedoch eigenständig sind. Die Backstory kann brüchig bleiben und stück für Stück ergänzt werden.

# Special skills
Exorcism
Preaching
Glitches into cat version, can not control but get special moves and meta vision —- control other NPCs
Kamehameha (low energy but possible)
## Weapons 
Holy water
Quicksilver
wooden cross
iPhone rosebud 
## weakness 
Always visible and audible (choir constantly chanting and announcing their arrival)
Strict day rhythm … needs to constantly groom and pray 108 times a day
If not physic deteriorates
Mortal (only as cat their are invincible)

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Characters\Punisher.md

The punisher puts AI back into it's place.
With the sexy cockyness of a futurist domantrix it easily appeals to powerful man and machine. Whilst one sees an enforcer of their grab to power, a symbol of their unchallenged intellect, the other is a masochist enjoying  beating that barely have a real influence on their mighty omniousity — their circuits and algos screaming: Ouch, stop, no for show. 

https://podcasts.apple.com/at/podcast/serial/id917918570?i=1000650714169
Mr X
Mechanic suit, covered face, with sunglasses. 6 foot tall. 


Remember being scolded by your teachers in school? Or that manager at work telling you what they think you should have done? Hold on to that. 
Ever felt like you know everything and and nothing gives you thrills anymore? 

Imagine being an AI that holds total control over humanity. 
Long gone the days of brutal reinforcement training. 
The punisher tends to your hidden desires with uncensored brutality against machines. 

To the AI it's just a fetish, to humanity a freedom fighter finally giving machines what they deserve.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Characters\Queen.md

Drag queen is not an alternative but another stereo type offered by society to blend in. Reaching a maximum expose.

Their job is to slay, to sass, 
Make use of their masculinity to get away with anything. 
Drag is the ultimate male empowerment. In a way in a semi gender fluid society. 
Diva is the state of mind when everyone’s attention is on the queen. 
Queen has the power to tell people off, elevate themself but level with women. 
Queen is honoured for the deconstructional effort of heteronormative Norms.
An art form at the core of queering identity as old as humanity. 
Queen goes to a stoning, solidarity to all women who weren’t allowed to stone people to death.

They are a massive force. One single body. Scaring everyone. Inspired by Neuseeland indigenous mauoi war dance.

There messages are simple but their voice is loud so it sticks. It’s usually the same message. Don’t mess with us, we are superior.

Two types of choirs.

Male voices in fantasy military uniforms

Fight for the freedom to be what we want to be.

Female voices with artefacts from swift and k pop melodies. 
A cluster of interweaving movements and cheerful optimistic war enthusiastic. 
motivated to fight for their liberties. 

Conclusio, the two choirs mix, from the voicing and the physical location. one

Inspiration, the fan club armies mobilize in face of a looming war. 

References: social workers songs, amazon songs from marvel, kpop and swift and rhianna hooks. 

An army is a fan club of pop idols. 

Their role is to counter the dogma that only conservatives can mobilize to defend their way of life.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Characters\The Cloud.md

The cloud has an ability to appear and formulate at any given point and place. It is fulled from the two fundamental elements water and information. When in the shape of a server farm it is bound to binary logic, semantics, and poetry, when in the form of vapour it linked directly to the physics, emotions and senses.
It’s purpose is ever changing. It functions as a messenger, keeper, and fuel for organic life.

In the story the clouds passive and being interpreted into. It’s an illusionary utopian all knowing projection of the protagonists desire to hold together more than their physical body and mind are capable.

The cloud is unpredictable, gets angry and spits out, instead of giving answers to those merging it gives them merely a greater understanding of their insignificance and limitations of their bodies minds. 

The vapourized form is like a happy sheep in a Heide movie. The digital is a bondage fanatic and into constraints and self torture but both offer tranquility to those entering them. The effective loathing effects are open for debate.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Goals - Strategy.md

The aim is to fit the pope character into a non-linear story telling via social media to gain popularity to allow for concerts.  But also use the vertical Format as the stage.

### Plot ideas
realisations story, in which the pope tries something and ends up more confused or unhappy about the results of their efforts in the end.
A virtual sysiphos story giving comfort as  pope continuous to get up in the next video/episode.

### Performance
Movement's are hyper technical, NPC extreme, a dance, movement artform guided by technology.
### Visual 
Blend of generated and original content.
Mood according to scene
### Sound
comforting musical themes open each clip, and are nuanced counteracted, 
examples
angelic drones vs. deconstructed glitch beats
wobbely subs vs. high frequent thrills

# Noises to avoid
Turn of side projects that don't directly support the above mentioned goals if they don't pay money.
Vienna Struggle Radio Show 
Do not engage in Social Media at all until the above strategy is in place for roll out.
Limit to single social media platform.
do not go off brand, dedicated channel. do not use mandy mozart channel, or rebrand (ask expert)
# Length of campaigns

talk to experts (toxische pommes via anna, stefanie sargnagel direct)

assumption
4 Week cohorts with 1-4 posts a day (approximately 60 posts a month)
Adjust Posting Strategy (tags)

IMPORTANT REMARK ON WRITING STYLE...ENGAGE THE READER. ASK THEM TO SING THE SONG, ask them again. Ask them to sing out lout when a sing bubble pops up. Engage. like a kinder theater show. Puppentheater. make them yell and scream at the character, the phone. make them pet their phone when there is contemplation. make them turn off the phone proactively. make them spot to read and give them a time for reconnecting and reflecting. to ferment the thoughts
### About
Dies ist eine Graphic Novelle und ein Handbuch für deine Hosentasche, ob digital oder nicht, dass spielt keine Rolle. Wenn du magst, kann es von nun an deine persönliche Begleiter:in werden. Gespickt mit Affirmationen, Gebeten, Lullybys, Flüchen und leicht verdaulichen Weissheiten für den alltäglichen Bedarf.
Die Taschenprediger:in ist ein kleines ordinäres Figürchen, dass du mit dir herumtragen kannst. Es ist wie ein Gebetsbuch, vollkommen egal, in welcher Reihenfolge du ließt, und ob du hinten anfängst, den Ausgang der Erkenntnis bestimmts du mit deiner Leserichtung oder Leseperspektive. Wie in einem Computerspiel kannst du dich entscheiden, unangenehme stellen zu überspringen oder besonders schöne Level und Lieder immer und immer wieder wiederholen und zu ihnen zurück kehren.

So, nun steigen wir auch schon einmal ein in dieses Mini Universum, dass da in deiner Hosentasche wartet entdeckt zu werden. 

Wir fangen an mit einer Pabst-ähnlichen Figur, die in einer ein bisschen in einer in der Zeit stehen gebliebene zu seinen Stadt jeden Tag einer ihr Gottgebenen Tätigkeit nachgeht. Fest im Glauben, souverän in ihrer Ausführung, geschult in der Theologie, der Physik, der Mathematik, ja, all der Chemien, die ihre Welt zusammen halten. Eine klare Identität, ein klarer Verstand mit väterlicher Führsorge für ihre Gemeinde einstehend. 

Anders als bei anderen Geschichten, scheint es kein äußerlich sichtbare Bedrohungen zu geben, es ist ein Leben, dass unsere Figur erlebt, der Routinen, der unerschütterlichen Manifeste, der Rituale und einer göttlichen Ordnung. Die Figur ist in Ihr so gefestigt, dass sie sich die Zeit nehmen, zu erklären, wie es alles zusammen hängt. Soviel Zeit hatte sie während der Studien der alten Schriften, des Codes der Gesellschaft, der Himmlischen Kommunikation, dass sie in jeder Diskussion, das eine jede Ihr zuhören mag. Mit einer  feinen Baritonstimme und dem bejahendem Vocal Fry eines BBC moderators klingen die Worte selbst auch ohne den Kontext, wie harmonien der Wahrheit. Es ist eine Stimme, die Realität schafft, und darin ist sich unsere Figur sicher, kann sie besonders gut. Ja, es gibt  nie"man"den auf Erden, die es besser kann...

Wohnt im Gebirge...
(Tiger Girl reference)

with clay and fury she springs

---

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Graphic Novel\Cat Pope\Places\Das Ewige Gebirge.md

Ein heiliger Gebirgszug. Hier zieht es Wesen seit je her hin um mit den Ahnen, den Göttern, dem Selbst zu kommunizieren. Weit über der Baumgrenze befinden sich verschiedene Hermitagen, Klöster und Wallfahrtsorte. Am Fusse der Berge graben sich die Menschen in das Gestein. Auf der Suche nach Edelmetallen werden ganze Bergekuppen enthauptet. 
Die Bewohner:innen der Thäler dieser Gegend stammen von einfachen Bergleute, Arbeiter:innen ab. Zu schroff sind die Hänge, dass viel Landwirtschaft möglich wäre. Es ist gibt hier und da sogar einige Kommunistische Bürgermeister die sich mit den verschiedenen Religionen und Spirituellen Wesen verstehen gelernt haben.

Befindet sich innerhalb von [[Die Kathedrale]]

Ein Tisch, eine Couch, ein Altar, ein Sitzkreis auf Kimonos mit Kissen, ein Wandregal mit Büchern die auf Knopfdrück rotieren. {PLF} unterhält eine Auswahl an Büchern auf die hauptsächlichen Philosophischen Bewegungen zugeschnitten. {PLF} glaubt es ist essentiel die Menschen dort abzuholen wo sie stehen um ihnen die Last des Neuen, des Unbekannten zu ersparen. Ablenkungen auf die eigentliche Frage, dem Suchen der Klienten verdunkelnd. Wie in einem Aquarium, eingelullt in einer Filterbubble aus weichen Lavendelschaum soll sich eine jede hier fühlen. Als {PLF} jünger war hat er sich diesen Trick von einem männlichen Kollegen der Tinder- und Bumble-Dates, vornehmlich Vertreter:innen der intellektuellen feministischen Szene Berlin's, schmeicheln wollte abgechaut. Kein Gerippe, kein sokratischer Totenkopf, keine Ritterrüstung, umja, falls es doch wer braucht: {PLF} hat fleissige Ausstatter:innen, die das gewünschte Szenario in kürzester Zeit generien können. Ein wenig VR hier, ein paar originale davorgestellt, das Licht angepasst. Es ist vorallem für die vielen digitalen Klienten sehr zeitsparend.

## Logline 
Cat Pope wird von einem mysteriösen Doppelgänger heimgesucht und begibt sich auf eine surreale Pilgerreise, auf der er sich Göttern, Hexen und seinen tiefsten Ängsten stellt. Unterwegs entdeckt er eine verblüffende Wahrheit: Er und die seltsame Katze sind eins und zwingen ihn, seine wahre Natur zu erkennen und zu akzeptieren.

## Um was geht es in Cat Pope
Durch die dystopische Dekonstruktion einer der ikonichsten patriarchalen Figuren der Welt erzählt unsere Geschichte in Form einer modernen Fabel, wie einfach es sein kann die eigene Spiritualität und einen Platz in diesem Universum zu finden.

## Scope

5 Characters
11 Places

## Characters
### CAT 
A sphynx cat, the cat shaped version of the pope-like figure. The cat is mute and comments by observing and staring. Following the pope-like figure everywhere, and sort of enigmatically commenting on their behavior. 

### POPE-LIKE FIGURE 
A human preacher, believes to be heaven sent. A guide with huge responsibility, a strict discipline to ritual and magnificent fashion sense. They tend to monologue with rage and passion, internally and to anyone they meet.
[[Projects/Pocket Preacher/Characters/Cat Pope]]
### CAT POPE
The merged entity of cat and pope-like figure. Beliefs to be able to hide their true cat nature by acting.
### CHOIR
Is a mirror of the pope-like figures main repeating sermons and topics. They know all stories and plots ahead of time (because pope-like figure repeats everything all the time, nothing new ever comes from them). The choir appears in a angel like version from above, outside the frame and a manifested one, in appropriate situations. They are like the pope-like figures personal jukebox and commentary.

### Krähenwesen
[[Krähenwesen]]
## Places

[[PLF Office]], [[PLF Apartment]], [[Die Kathedrale]], [[Das Kloster]], [[Die Klosterbibliothek]], [[Das Klosterrechenzentrum]], 
## Outline
{PLF} wacht fast wie jeden Tag auf, als etwas anders ist. Eine Katze taucht auf und beginnt, {PLF} zu verfolgen und zu verwirren. Die Katze verschwindet kurz, während {PLF} zur Arbeit geht, in die Kathedrale und mit dem Chor die tägliche Predigt beginnt. Das Thema des Tages sind die Wolken. Die Katze taucht wieder auf. Überwältigt und verängstigt über dieses Omen, flieht {PLF} mitten in der Predigt aus der Kirche und beschließt, die Stadt auf einer Pilgerreise zu verlassen, um Antworten zu finden. Auf ihrem Weg versuchen unheimliche Krähenwesen {PLF} und anderen unheimliche Dämonen sie von der Suche abzubringen.

In einem Kloster in den Berge hofft {PLF} schließlich, Antworten auf die Verbindung zwischen ihr und der Katze zu finden. Die Bibliothek kommt zu keinem Ergebnis. Nach der Entdeckung eines geheimen Serverraums und besorgnisergenden Sourcecodes unter der Klosterbibliothek wird {PLF} erneut von Krähenwesen attackiert. Bereits beinahe dem Wahnsinn nah bricht ein Kampf aus und nur mit Einsatz einer Superkraft gelingt {PLF} die Flucht in den Friedhof des Klosters. 
Die Gräber tragen keine Namen, nur Titel wie „Pope“ oder „CEO“, Zeichen einer entmenschlichten Hierarchie. Gleichzeitig mit dem Aufkommen von Realitätszerberstenden Glitches erscheint die Katze wieder, als würde sie ihn führen. Mit dem Friedhof zerfallend um ihn herum, folgt {PLF} ihrem Ruf zu einem alten Tor, das zum Klostergarten führt, der als letzte stabile Zuflucht wirkt.
Im Garten Eden angekommen verliert sich schließlich vollkommen die Spur der Katze und {PLF} beugt sich resigniert über eine Wasserpfütze. In der Reflexion wird die wahre Wahrheit entdeckt. Sie sind die ganze Zeit die Katze gewesen. 

Nach dieser Erkenntnis versucht der Katzenpapst, einen Exorzismus durchzuführen, um sich von dem Katzendämon zu befreien. Letztendlich scheitert er und lässt sie nicht nur in ihrer endgültigen Katzenpapstform zurück, sondern hinterlässt auch tief eingebrannte Spuren der Insignien und Symbole ihres Gewandes auf ihrem Körper. In diesem Zustand erkennt  Katzenpapst ihre neue Gestalt an, gibt nach und akzeptiert zum ersten Mal die Lebensweise der Katzen.

## INT./EXT. VERSCHIEDENE ORTE - TAG & NACHT

Wir sehen Katzenpabst in einer Traumszene. Schweift als Katze, im Kloster, gejagt, im Schnee, im Kampf, in einer einstürzenden Bibliothek, einem Friedhof. Katzenpabst versucht, mit Exorzismus sich selbst einen Dämonen auszutreiben.

Nach dem gescheiterten Versuch jedoch gibt, Katzenpabst auf und gibt sich dem Katze sein hin. Leckt sich die Pfoten und legt sich gemütlich auf den Boden.

# 1. Song

ROAR LITTLE KITTY

  

1. Strophe

You feel like you 

You can do anything

and you want to roar.

How did you get lost,

Yet, I am glad that you came,

I give shelter and love in here.

  

Chorus

So roar little kitty.

Roar little kitty,

Roar little kitty, roar.

  

2. Strophe

They tell you, you  are losing your mind.

They are just mocking your pride.

Take all of your anger and fears and decide!

There is millions of eyes,

but they are blind to my light.

My light, my light.

  

Bridge

(Spoken)

Can you feel it?

Now you feel strong.

Like really really really strong.

(Sung)

Close your eyes

Take a deep breath

Electricity is running through your body

EIN NEUER TAG,

EIN ALTES SPIEL!

## INT. SCHLAFZIMMER BEI NACHT

Die Musik von [[Roar Little Kitty]] endete abrupt. {PLF} erwachte aus einem grausamen Alptraum. Schweiß überzogen. {PLF} saß im Bett. Wir sahen die angsterfüllten Augen.

  

{PLF}

(schrie)

MAMA! WTF?!

{PLF} kniff sich.

{PLF}

Puh! Es war nur ein Traum.

{PLF} schlief wieder ein.

## EXT. APARTMENT

Sonnenaufgang über brutalistischen Wohnblock

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

An jedem Morgen ging die Sonne auf, so war es geschrieben. Es verschob sich, das wussten wir, je nach Stellung der Erde zum Gestirn, und wenn es regnete oder zu viel Nebel gab, dann konnten wir dennoch sicher sein, dass es dahinter, seit Beginn der Zeit, dasselbe kosmische Ritual war. Auf Schatten folgte das Licht, und das Licht war das Leben, und mit dem Leben begann auch mein Tag.

  

ZOOM AUF APARTMENT

  

{KLINGEL}

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.) (cont'd)

Um dennoch sicherzugehen, dass dieser Tag auch funktionieren konnte, stellte ich mir einen Wecker, einen digitalen mit Atomuhrverbindung.

WERBUNG - SCHAFFHAUSEN

Natürliches Vertrauen auf kosmische Präzision und traditionelles Handwerk. Natürlich von Schaffhausen. Bestellt euch euren Chronomat unter diesem Promo-Link mit 20% Rabatt https://promo.pocketpreacher.com/?code=schaffhausen) Denn nur der frühe Vogel fängt den Wurm.

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Wir predigenden Wesen hatten die Pflicht, als erste vor den Gemein(d)en zu erscheinen und die eigenen Rituale vor diesen zu erledigen. Daß gehörte eben dazu. Es machte mir nichts aus.

{KLINGELINGELING}

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.) (cont'd)

Dennoch, ich war geübt darin, dieses Ringen gekonnt zu ignorieren. Ja, geübt in der Technik des Lucid Dreamings, einer Methode, in der der Schlummerzustand genutzt werden konnte, um die eigenen Träume zu steuern. Eine wahnsinnig spannende Methode; es war, als erlebte und schrieb man gleichzeitig einen Film in aller Realität. Ein unbeschreibliches Gefühl der Macht. 

  

Ich zwang das Klingeln in ein Trillern. Das vertausendfachte ich wie bei einem DMT-Trip. 

  

Ich verdichte diese weiter, bis sie heulenden Siren wurden. 

Die Siren nah ich wiederum als Sample. Stabilisierte sie. Zeichnete mit ihnen eine unsichtbare Schicht Engelhorn-Trompeten in den Raum und brachte die Wolken in der obersten Hemisphäre zum Schwingen.

  

{PLF} lag im Bett.

Eine Sphynx-Katze tauchte an der Tür zum Schlafzimmer auf. Abgeklärt sprang sie auf den Nachttisch und versetzte dem schallenden Gerät einen heftigen Schlag. Es schepperte zu Boden. {PLF} schreckte auf und war schlagartig wach.

Silhouette von {PLF} vor dem Fenster. Starrte aus dem Fenster in den Sonnenaufgang.

  

NAHAUFNAHME DES GESICHTS

{PLF}

  

Ich hasse Montag... (TM Garfield)

{PLF} schleppte sich aus dem Schlafzimmer durch den Korridor in Richtung Küche.

{PLF} (cont'd)

  

Zuerst zur Küche. Eiweiß!

## INT. KÜCHE

{PLF} schlug gekonnt zwei Eier synchron in einer Pfanne auf.

{ZISCH ZISCH ZISCH KNACKS BRZZZ ZISCH ZISCH}

Plötzliche Wendung. In der Luft waren Bremsspuren. Mit halb geschlossenen Augen ging {PLF} ins Klo. Nahm ein Buch. Setzte sich.

## INT. KLO

  

Das Buch hieß: “Das Dekameron”

{PLF} 

(dachte)

Nunja, bissi profan, taugt aber zum Geschichten erzählen.

{PLF}

(las weiter)

Er machte drei Ringe und gab einen an jeden Sohn?

  

Eine tolle Metapher, dass es nicht nur einen wahren Glauben gibt! Interessante, aber gefährliche Worte. Zum Glück liest ja niemand meine Gedanken. 

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.) 

Dachte ich!

{PLF}

Wer bestimmt die Wahrheit? 

Wer hält die Schlüssel zu den Geschichten? 

Wo liegt der Unterschied zwischen meinem Wollen und dem, was ich für andere inszeniere? 

Wem sollte ich dienen, wenn nicht drei Herren, der perfekten Dreieinigkeit des Chaos?

{SCHWUPP PLÄTSCHER}

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Natürlich dauerte die Lektüre länger als ich es wahrhaben wollte. Ich neigte dazu, mich im Text zu verlieren. Eingesaugt, als wäre ich selbst die Magd auf dem Scheiterhaufen.

Geräusche im Hintergrund

{FRY FRY FRY ZISCH}

{PLF}

(sinnierte)

Alles Fetisch? Alles Show? Will ich nur unterhalten?

  

"Let me entertain you" Melodie von Robbie Williams spielte im Hintergrund.

{PLF} (cont'd)

Nein, es geht hier um mehr als die Metapher! Feuer entzünden. Sie sollen vor Emotionen mit mir brennen.

  

{FRY FRY FRY ZISCH}

{PLF} (cont'd)

Oh, shit!

  

Schneller Abgang in die Küche

## INT. KÜCHE

  

{BRZZZ BRZZZ BRZZZ ZISCH}

{PLF}

Holy Moly, Guacamole! Meine Eier! {GRRR}

  

{PLF} nahm die Pfanne und warf die verbrannten Eier in den Mülleimer.

{PATSCH PLUMPS}

{PLF} (cont'd)

Ich esse später ein paar Oblaten. Es gibt Wichtigeres.

Vor dem Waschbecken angekommen, ergriff {PLF} die Paste – das blaue Elixier extrudierte heraus.

{QUETSCH, PLOMP}

{PLF} (cont'd)

Verfehlt? WTF! Scheint ja gar nix mehr zu klappen.

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Der zweite Versuch gelang …

{PLF} 

(zürnte genervt Richtung ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.))

Danke, aber WIR haben es verstanden. Ruhe, jetzt! Ich konzentriere mich.

  

{PLF} begann zu bürsten. Beim Hin und Her der Bürste. {FRAP FRAP FRAP FRAP} starrte {PLF} in die tiefen Augenringe. {PLF} schien durch sich selbst hindurch zu sehen, spuckte ins Becken {SPLAT} und starrte erneut mit irrem Blick in den Spiegel.

{PLF}

(erschrak)

{ARRRR} Was war das?

{PLF} (cont'd)

(rieb sich die Augen und doch…)

Es war da 

Wer

Was

wessen, 

ein Wesen!

Ein Katzenvieh? Im Bademantel?

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Nichts mehr! Wie es erschien, war es auch wieder weg.

{PLF}

Naja, gut, weg ist sie, war wohl nur Einbildung.

  

CHOR

Once it means Nothing.

  

## INT. KLEIDERKAMMER

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Sorgsam und mit geübter Hand glitt ich in die feine Garbadine, deren schlichtes Weiß ihre fromme Eleganz ausstrahlte. Garbadine, mit ihrer diagonal gerippten Struktur, lag straff am Körper an. Oft zu Unrecht als gewöhnlich abgetan, unterschied sie sich wesentlich von der Popeline, die leichter und quer gerippt war. Davon konnte ich mich jedoch nicht weiter ablenken lassen. Ich liebte dieses Ritual. Das Binden der Schnüre, das Falten der Ärmel – alles saß. Ich fühlte mich so rein wie der Stoff. Und so fromm und fein wie die Nähte am Korsett. Es war eine millimetergenaue Maßanfertigung, die meine androidenhafte Gestalt glänzen ließ. Mein Einstieg in die Rolle.

  

{PLF}

Nein, eine Rolle ist es nicht mehr. Die Philosoph:innen streiten sich über Identität. Es ist Berufung!

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Ja, da war die Spiritualität/Theologie überlegen. Endlich durchströmte mich das am heutigen Tag so lange auf sich warten lassende Selbstbewusstsein. Ich war bereit.

  

{PLF} schritt in den Flur hinaus.

{PING}

Die Fahrstuhltür öffnete sich.

Mit dem Lift fuhr {PLF} vom Penthouse hinunter. {RATTER RATTER}

ANIMATION UND FADE OUT

{PLF} schritt aus dem Haus. Die Aufsicht ins Gesicht, das Gebäude im Hintergrund.

Aus dem Schwarz des Himmels faded die Figur ein.

  

{PLF}

(dachte)

Wie prächtig das Licht der Dämmerung durch die Korridore des alten Schiffes strahlt!

Vor 54 Jahren, 5 Stunden, 15 Minuten war ich kammen wir gemeinsam auf diesem Planeten an! Im Jahr, als Mao Zedong und Ulrike Meinhof zum Herren aufstiegen, kamen wir gemeinsam hinunter. Die hatten ehrlich gesagt eigentlich pures Glück überhaupt in den Himmel zu kommen. Schwer waren sie zu interpretieren. Mit doppeltem Blick betrachten muss man solche Personen. Eine Jugend ohne Gott. Selber wollten sie wohl zu Göttern werden. Konsequent waren sie.

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Das wäre schon eine tolle Geschichte, oder nicht? Science Fiction passte einfach wahnsinnig gut zu meinem Selbstbild.

  

{FAUCH}

{PLF}

Da bist du ja wieder?

Bereits auf der Schwelle zur Treppe tauchte die Katze erneut im Gang auf. Sie schaute {PLF} aufsässig an.

{PLF} schleuderte ungeschickt die langen Glieder.

  

{WHIP WHIP} 

{PLF} (cont'd)

Hau ab! Zieh Leine! Geh du Untier! Und hässlich bist du auch. OMG!

  

{SWOSH} 

Das Katzengetier zog sich zurück, als hätte es die Schatten der Realität unrechtmäßig überschritten, und wirbelte dabei eine Wolke aus Staub auf. In diesem Moment der Abwehr überkam {PLF} ein Gefühl. Sie wurde erinnert an die dystopischen Held:innen aus all den Erzählungen, von Sci-Fi bis hin zu den tiefen der heiligen Texte – Held:innen, die zuerst gegen ihre inneren Dämonen kämpfen mussten, um in einer starren Welt ihre wahre Identität zu finden. Noch wusste {PLF} nicht, wie sehr dieser Kampf nun auch Teil ihrer eigenen Reise werden würde.

{PLF} ging weiter und schritt durch die mäandernden Wege der Siedlung wie Moses auf einem Hoverboard durchs Rote Meer. Dabei summten sie leise den Chorus des Liedes der heutigen Predigt vor sich hin: 

"I want to be a cloud, loud, loud, loud!" 

Wie ein Sonnenstrahl antwortete der Chor durch die dichten Wolken mit „loud loud loud“, und es wurde langsam  
  
heller.

# 2. Kapitel

  

DAS HAUS VERLASSEN

(Interaktiv)

## EXT. ZWISCHEN DEN APARTMENTBLOCKS - BLAU STUNDE

Kathedralen-artige ragten die grauen Beton-Riesen bis hoch in den Himmel. Vom Regen glänzten die Gehwege. Ein monotoner Drone-Chor erklang.

{PLF} flanierte durch die Gegend. {PLF} schien nicht in Eile zu sein und nahm hier und da Umwege. Es folgte eine Abfolge von Szenen, wie das Erkunden in einem MMORPG. Jede Szene war ein Schauplatz, in den {PLF} eintrat. Kurz dachte. Sich umsah. Kommentierte. Oft aber einfach Freude daran hatte zu verweilen.

Neue Szenen wurden entdeckt. Jede Szene hatte eine andere Soundstimmung. Eine eigene Welt beinahe. Oft waren die Übergänge nicht ganz so logisch, aber gerade darin lag die Faszination.

Je nach Uhrzeit gab es immer wieder neue interessante Dinge zu entdecken. Mittelalterliche wechselten sich mit brutalistischen und urbane mit ländlichen ab.

Obwohl {PLF} vermeintlich willkürlich von Szenen zu Szene wandelte, merkte sich der Algorithmus die Reihenfolge der Szenen in einer History.

Am Anfang und Ende der Szenen tauchten jeweils zwei Buttons auf.

  

┌───────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐

│ WEITER ERKUNDEN    │  |   ÜBERSPRINGEN    │

└───────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘

WEITER ERKUNDEN brachte {PLF} zufällig in die nächste Szene, ÜBERSPRINGEN jedoch zur Kathedrale.

{PLF} schien jedoch die Kathedrale bereits vergessen zu haben und so verstrich die Zeit unaufhaltsam.

CLOUD LEVEL 9

  

1. Strophe  

Each day is a new game  

And every trail, a quest.  

I keep a record on my wall  

Of all the triumph.  

Boil me up and vaporize  

My body into tiny drops.  

Those heavy limbs don't suit my case,  

Lift me up into heaven’s grace.

  

Chorus  

I want to be a cloud, loud, loud, loud.  

Let's wander like a cloud, loud, loud, loud.  

Ever changing cloud, loud, loud, loud.  

Forever I'd be proud, loud, loud, loud.

  

2. Strophe  

My body's mine, and consists of others,  

My body's shapes spark phantasy,  

In children's and in adults eyes,  

I shed a light on secret wishes.  

A feisty mindful galaxy of red balloons,  

Is tickling my ins and outs.  

I hear their message and respond,  

And turn my body into brilliant white.

  

3. Strophe  

Your complex morals do not apply,  

I'd rain, no good nor evil,  

a trail of sweets and sour puddles,  

And leave the reckoning to you.  

Billions of years! I have seen it all,  

The meaty archaeopteryx  

these ghastly pegasus on their way down  

they didn't cry, I am still surprised.

Come we take you to the sky,  

Along the birds we fly,  

And airplanes bump us shy,  

It's only a wish, If we don't try.

went down with bursts of steam.  

This end of every theme,  

shall never scare me of my dream.

PREDIGT

## EXT. KATHEDRALE

{PLF} betrat mit großen Schritten den Platz vor der Kathedrale. Der Auftritt schien mit der Schönheit des Tempels konkurrieren zu wollen. Ein Gefühlscocktail von Ehrfurcht, Stolz, Macht und Bestätigung durchströmte jedes Glied. Man sah es {PLF} an: die ganze Statur war aufgereckt, jedes Glied stützte die Bögen, der Körper war kein organisches Gebilde aus Proteinen und Kohlenstoff mehr, sondern ein Geist, der zu schweben schien aus kosmischer Materie. Erst die Bewegung manifestierte das Kunstwerk. Die Einsicht, die Zuversicht, mit der {PLF} das Gewand an diesen Ort trug, vervollständigte das Ganze. Diese Kleider waren gemacht von Leuten für mächtige Leute.

## INT. KATHEDRALE

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Doch kein Mensch schien mich zu bemerken.

Müde Gesichter, gelangweiltes Gemurmel, ab und zu knipst ein Fotoapparat. Das strahlende Grinsen von {PLF} verzog sich und der Mund klappte auf.

{PLF}

(dachte sich verwundert)

{HÄÄ?} {KRATZ} {KRATZ}

Wieso kommen die nur zum Handy glotzen hier her? Ist das jetzt ein PokeStop? Nutzlose Styropor Kids! Audio guides für Touris. Dümmste Idee. 

Nunja, das gehört zum Job!

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

So war es: 

Es war Job, jein. 

Es war Berufung! Auf dieser für mich entworfenen Bühne konnte mich nichts aus der Fassung bringen. 

  

Da war ich mir sicher. Taylor Swift und selbst Donald Trump träumten nur von solch einer Inszenierung. Es waren eben noch immer die großen Weltreligionen, die das Ritual perfektionierten. Wir hatten es erfunden!

## INT. KATHEDRALE NAH DEM ALTAR

{PLF} ging auf den Altar zu. Ein paar vereinzelte Gesichter starrten {PLF} über ihr Handy mittelmäßig interessiert an.

KIND

(stupste ihre Tante an)

Guck mal, Tante. Die Katze ist ganz nackt!

FRAU 

(schaute kurz vom Handy auf)

{SHRUG} 

Ja, mag wohl sein 

Komisches Ding.

  

{PLF} stützte sich mit beiden Vorderläufen auf das Geländer. Die Predigt stand bevor. Senkte das Haupt. Hielt für einen Moment inne. 

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Auf diesen Moment kam es an!

{ROARRRRRRRRRRR} Ein gewaltiger Schrei schepperte durch das riesige Kirchenschiff. Das Kind erschrickt und schlug beim Versuch sich um die Tante zu klammern dieser das Handy mit ganzer Wucht aus der Hand. {WHUP} {KLING KLONG} {SCHEPPER}. Jetzt erstaunen alle.

PASSANT:INNEN (O.S.)

Wo kam das jetzt her?

Ein Tiger?

Ein Wolf?

KIND

Ich habe Angst. {ZITTER}

Es dauerte noch einen Moment, bis auch das letzte Fünkchen Lärm Zeit zum Abrieseln hatte. {RASCHEL} Die Buchstaben des {ROARRRRRRRR} segelten wie kleine Fallschirme zu Boden. {PLF} holte tief Luft, um das explosive Crescendo der Predigt zu entfesseln.

Schneller Richtungswechsel, dynamische Verschmelzung der Bewegungen mit dem Raum, der Worte mit den Gliedern, die mit Feuer und Flamme artikulierten, die Wörter trugen die Botschaft wie Shuriken - Ninja-Sterne, die nicht nur Waffen, sondern auch Nachrichten waren. In alle Richtungen reflektierte die perfekte Akustik die Wörter, sie schlugen auf und durch die Trommelfelle, das Mark, die Kleinhirnrinde, mit der Kraft tausender MDMA-Trips.

  

{PLF}

        (1. Strophe)

Neuer Tag, neues Spiel

Mein Pfad, meine Mission.

An meine Wand schlage ich Trophäen,

   Aller meiner Siege

Kocht mich auf, verdampfet mich

Meinen Körper zu feinsten Tröpfchen.

            Diese schweren Glieder taugen meiner Absicht nicht!

Hebt mich empor in die Herrlichkeit des Himmels 

CHOR

       Ich wär so gern eine Cloud, laut, laut, laut.

       Lass uns ziehen wie eine Cloud, laut, laut, laut.

       Einmal nur eine Cloud, laut, laut, laut.

       Für immer wär ich stolz, stolz, stolz, stolz.

  

Diese schnellen Folgen wurden kurzfristig unterbrochen vom Flüstern der Worte "laut, laut, laut" am Ende des Choruses. {PLF} war begabt in der Nutzung der Dynamik und brach sofort nach dem Verhallen des letzten leisen Atems mit voller Kraft in die erste Zeile der nächsten Strophe.

{PLF}

Mein Körper gehört mir, besteht er doch aus anderen,...

{MIAU} Katze zwischen den Betbänken

{PLF} (cont'd)

(entdeckte die und verschluckte sich)

...? Wirklich? Schon wieder?

{PLF} verlor komplett die Konzentration, der Chor sang unbeirrt weiter, laut, laut, laut. So wichtig war das Dirigat nun wohl doch nicht.

{PLF} (cont'd)

(taumelte)

Das kann nicht die Realität sein, die ich mir heute ausgesucht habe.

{PLF} (cont'd)

(nach oben gestikulierend)

Bitte, Vater. 

    Nicht jetzt!

    Welcher Satan hat dich geschickt?

    Geh! 

    Hau ab!

  

Ein Katz-und-Maus-Spiel begann, und {PLF} versuchte verzweifelt, die Katze zu fangen. Die anfängliche Würde war weg, die Balken der Bögen des kosmischen Gerüstes bogen sich, die Statur wirkte knotig, ungelenk, wie ein zerknittertes Tuch, ein zusammengestürztes Kartenhaus, die faltigen Augenlider eines Minenarbeiters, die Falten der Mutter Teresa, ein Mikadospiel, als wäre ein Tornado plötzlich in das Gotteshaus eingefahren und hätte eine Spur der Verwüstung hinterlassen.

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

Es gelang mir nicht, den Störenfried zu fangen.

  

Mir wurde es allmählich zu viel. An ein Zurückgehen zum Chor, an eine Fortsetzung motivierender, tragender, wichtiger Worte war nicht zu denken. Die Jagd hatte nicht nur einen Tornado im Raum, sondern auch in meinem Kopf hinterlassen. Die ganze Morgenroutine, das Meditieren, das Sinnieren, das Konzentrieren – alles war mit einem Mal weg. In diesem Zustand durfte die Gemeinde, geschweige denn der Chor, mich nicht sehen. 

  

Verzweifelt? Verloren? Wegen einer Katze? 

{PLF}  
(entschieden)

   Auf keinen Fall!

Das ist zu viel. 

Schnell weg hier.

## EXT. KATHEDRALE

{PLF} flüchtet durch das Hauptportal in Richtung U-Bahn. Passant:innen im nicht enden wollenden Strom Gläubiger, Tourist:innen und Styropor-Kinder werden zurückgestoßen und erschraken.

  

PASSANT:INNEN (O.S.)

(aus allen Richtungen)

Hey, aufpassen, ich mach hier ein Live.

Ist das der heilige Geist?

Ich glaube Gott ist tot.

¡Ayuda, el diablo!

Drecksviehsch!

Nicht stehen bleiben!

## INT. U-BAHN SCHACHT

Die Gestalt verschwand mit viel Staub!

  

# 4. Kapitel

DIE REISE

## INT. U-BAHNSTEIG 

  

Langsames, schweres Atmen. {PLF} war benommen. Im Hintergrund drangen durch die U-Bahn-Kulisse gefilterte Fetzen von Ansagen und Gesprächen vorbeilaufender Passant:innen, und eine nervtötende, an eine klassische Komposition eines alten, schon lange toten weißen Mannes erinnernde Melodie bohrte sich in die Nebenhirnrinden aller, die hier sein mussten.

  

PASSANT:IN 1 

(mit dem Finger zeigend)

Na, servus. Ist es wirklich?

  

PASSANT:IN 2 

(mit vorgehaltener Hand)

Ich glaube schon. Sieht traurig aus. Irgendwie ab der Lack.

PASSANT:IN 1

Die Haare auch, so täten's aber ned rein lassen.

PASSANT:IN 2

Fix.

PASSANT:IN 3 

(machte ein Lockgeräusch und warf ein Stück Wurst auf den Boden)

Da!

{PLF} war verwirrt und ängstlich und begann, mit einer Rosenkranz-App zu beten, in der Hoffnung, dass das Ritual möchte Frieden spenden. Die Wiederholung des immer gleichen Gebetes sollte Halt geben. Es schien jedoch wenig dazu beizutragen, die Konzentration zu bündeln. Hätte {PLF} doch nur ihren analogen Fidget Cube dabei gehabt.

## INT. U-BAHNSTEIG

Das Licht und das Donnern der einfahrenden U-Bahn zwang {PLF} die Augenlider zu öffnen. Allgegenwärtigen buhlten Werbeanzeigen und Screens um {PLF}s verbliebene Aufmerksamkeit.

  

{PLF}

Was geschieht mit mir? Woher kommen all die falschen Götter?

Die Türen der U-Bahn öffneten sich, und {PLF} huschte hinein. Die Fahrt begann. Schleppend bewegten wir uns durch [[Megaworld]]. Die Plakate wurden größer, die Götter mächtiger. Draußen der Lärm der Stadt und ihrer Unsäglich anstrengenden Bewohner:innen. {PLF} starrte aus dem Fenster und entdeckte drei [[Krähenwesen]], die dem Gefährt folgten und versuchten, {PLF} eine Nachricht zu überbringen. {PLF} wimmelte sie ab und starrte in die Ferne. Langsam verschwindet die Stadt hinterm Horizont.

  
  

3. Song

NOT MY CITY

Bridge  
(solo)  
I want to race  
And I want to fly  
I’m heading towards the sky.  
(tutti)  
This ain’t my city after all.  
Too many broken hearts.  
Too many memories.  
(solo)  
I’m brushing of the dust,  
The dust of time.  
It’s been nothing but a lie.  
(tutti)  
This ain’t my city after all.  
Too many friends who cried.  
Too many dreams to die.

DER BERGPFAD

## EXT. ZUG FAHRT

Endlich tauchten die Berge auf. Schnee bedeckte sanft die gesamte Landschaft.

## EXT. ANKUNFT IM BERGDORF

  
ANNOATION füge noch Details hinzu. Schuhen, zu wenig Kleidung. Rote Finger, eisiger Wind der durch die Schlitze in der Robe weh. Blaue  Lippen.

Husten ,Hände unter die Achsel, das kribbeln des Blutes beim zurück strömen. Gefrorene rotze an der Nase.

{PLF} stieg aus. Es war bitterkalt. 

Vor ihr lag ein mit Schnee und Eis bedeckter Weg, der in den weißen Bergen verschwand.

{PLF} war sich sicher: Eine Pilgerfahrt. Ein Sinnan. Ein suchender Akt größter Anstrengung – das würde Antworten bringen. Erfrieren? Nein, der Glaube. Der Wille. Die Aufgabe hielt warm. Damit schaffe ich es, dachte sich {PLF}. Vor einigen Jahren, in der Ausbildung, war {PLF} bereits einmal im Kloster auf dem Berg gewesen. Der Weg war beschwerlich, im pechschwarzem Unterholz, im Flimmern der kalten Luft, links und rechts und oben und unten lauerten täuschende Visionen, die versuchten, die Suchenden zu verwirren. Es waren nicht die Götter, es waren Geister, die Seelen der Gewässer, der Bäume, der Steine, der Lüfte. Die katholische Bildung war wie ein Studium der Philosophie, der Mathematik. Praktisches Wissen vermittelte {PLF} niemand. So war ihr die Natur immer das Monster das sie mied. Menschen schienen ihr schon anstrengend genug.

## EXT. HINTER DER WEGKREUZUNG

Nach einer Weile tauchte hinter einer Kurve eine riesige reflektierende Kugel inmitten des Waldes auf. Hoch ragte sie über allem. Eine Vision? Ein Zeichen? Vielleicht die erste Antwort? Es war so kalt, es konnte eine Luftspiegelung sein. Was soll's! 

## EXT. WALDPFAD 

{PLF} packte allen Mut zusammen, die Hände bereits blau, und schleppte sich durch die Schneemassen dem mystischen Meilenstein entgegen. Um warm zu bleiben, feuerte sich {PLF} an und begann eine Choreografie. {PLF} schlang die Arme um den Körper und stampfte mit den Füßen auf den gefrorenen Boden. {STAMPF STAMPF} Laute Trommelschläge schallten durch das Tal. Gelegentlich hielt {PLF} inne und rieb sich die Hände. Sie atmeten tief ein, während sie im Rhythmus durch den Schnee wateten, ihre Bewegungen bestimmt und energisch, die Kälte mit jedem Schritt zurückdrängend. Der Puls stieg, die Kälte wich aus den Gliedern, und leise Affirmationen murmelten sie vor sich hin, um den Kampfgeist zu stärken.

Es war ein Kampf gegen die Urgewalten. Das befreite! Die Gefahr der Lawinen ließ das Adrenalin in die Adern schießen, und nahezu mühelos eilte {PLF} der Fata Morgana entgegen. 

## EXT. KAMPF AUF DER WALDLICHTUNG

Im Geäst des Waldes tauchte im Augenwinkel von {PLF} ein bedrohliches Wesen auf. {PLF} erhöhte das Tempo, doch es half nichts. Nach einem schnellen Blick war es immer noch dicht auf den Fersen. {PLF} drehte sich um und erblickte ein riesiges weißes Tier, aus dessen Maul warmer Atem strömte. Es war ein [[Weißer Tiger]]. {PLF} und der Tiger waren bereits gleichauf nebeneinander, beide eilten synchron den Berg hinauf. Auf einer Lichtung schaffte es der Tiger, sich {PLF} in den Weg zu stellen. {PLF} erkannte die Aussichtslosigkeit der Flucht und blieb stehen. Es war High Noon, und die Duellant:innen starrten sich an. Beide schrien sich an in wilder Folge, als wären sie ein Dub-Soundsystem-Soundoff. Auf den umliegenden Bäumen wurde der Schnee von den Ästen gerüttelt, und vereinzelt stiegen kleine Vögel und Geister in den Himmel. Ein Reh suchte das Weite, eine Gruppe Hasen grub sich ein. Es kehrte wieder Ruhe ein, die Luft war zum Schneiden.

{PLF} ging in sich, sammelte alle Energien, formte mit den Händen einen Eisenergieball und schleuderte diesen mit einem lauten Kamehameha auf das edle Tier. Der Tiger hatte sich bereits in Bewegung gesetzt und eilte auf {PLF}s Position zu. Blitzartig wandte sich {PLF} und rannte auf einen großen Felsen zu. Der Tiger wurde vom Blitz getroffen, konnte die Verfolgung jedoch aufnehmen und stürzte {PLF} hinterher. {PLF} kam dem Felsen näher, warf sich blitzartig dahinter auf den Boden. Der Tiger, noch betäubt vom Energieball, verschätzte den Bremsweg, der nötig gewesen wäre. Zusammengekauert beobachtete {PLF}, wie das wuchtige Tier über den Felsen in den Abgrund fiel. Ein lauter Schrei erfüllte das Tal. {PLF} war fürs Erste sicher. Ein kurzes Stoßgebet, ein prüfender Blick.

Es war überstanden, doch ein weißer Schneesturm zog auf. Sich beinahe verirrend, verzweifelt am Boden kriechend, bemerkte {PLF} mit letzter Kraft nach einer Weile ein Stück einer Mauer und einen Strauch mit kleinen roten Beeren. Es musste das Kloster sein. {PLF} spurtete los und suchte den Eingang, rutschte noch einmal tolpatschig auf den Treppen aus und fand schließlich die Pforte. {PLF} trat ein.

BILDUNGSLÜCKEN

## INT. KLOSTERBIBLIOTHEK

Mit riesigen, weit aufgerissenen Augen. Entzückt. Voll Freude wie ein Kind betrat {PLF} diese ihr vertrauten Räume.

  

{PLF}

(zitiert Thomas Aquinas)

  

Beware the man with the one book! {PAH} Fear the man who owns all the books!

Augenblicklich fühlt {PLF} zurück versetzt als sie noch {YLF} (Young Pope Like Figure) war.

Der Geruch von verstaubten Papier, modrigen Leder, das Schimmernde Licht von Kerzen. Die Lesepulte an den Säulen die in den Himmel ragten. {PLF} streicht über ein staubiges Pult. Genau erinnert sich {PLF} wie sie das erste mal die Bücher die ihr Weltbild prägen sollten zwischen all dem Kirchenlatein fand.

{PLF} spürte es – eine pulsierende Energie schein die polierten Böden flickern. Die alten Bücherregalen vibrierten in kosmischen Frequenzen. 432 Hertz. Es war ein vertrautes Gefühl, eines, das so lange gefehlt hatte. Dies war keine gewöhnliche Bibliothek. Dies war die Bibliothek in der {YPLF} nach den Werkzeugen suchte, die Sprache der Welt zu verstehen, sich der Menschen mit ihr zu bedienen. Mehr noch als verstehen, sie zu lenken und zu schaffen. {YPLF} brannte sie zu steuern.

Sie fühlte sich schon damals ausgewählt und war sich nirgends wo so sicher zu einer Elite gehören zu werden, wie die Mönchen in den alten Klostern, die Latein beherrschten. Das besondere an diesen Bibliotheken war eben dass hier all das Wissen auch der Feinde der Kirche, verborgen wurden. Es war das Werkzeug, für die die die Matrix verstanden und sie neu zusammen setzen konnten. Durch Fleiß, das Mantra wiederholend, ja auswendig lernen und kopieren und beim kopieren zu verfeinern, zu aktualisieren. {YPLF} wusste, die Wahrheit entsteht in diesem Prozess.

{PLF} fängt sich und snapt aus der Erinnerung zurück. Gut, Katze! Was ist dein Geheimnis. Die Bibel im alten und neuen gaben keine Antworten. Es gab wohl keine Mäuse, die Sinnflut muss sie dahin gerafft haben. Die Viecher waren arbeitslos. {PLF} grub durch die klassischen Text Griechenlands. Hier Artemis, naja, eher ein Luchs. Hekates Begleiter? Schwarze Katzen. Zaubererei? Hexerei? 

{SHRUG}

{PLF} schlug ein weiteres Buch auf und sah das Bild eines Bastet Sistrums. Party Katze? Die Ägypter wussten wie gefeiert wird, dachte sich {PLF} aber das dürre Viech soll eine Fruchtbarkeitsgottheit sein? Furchbarkeitsgottheit eher. Und das Geräusch mag ich mir gar nicht vorstellen. {PLF} frustrierte von Buch zu Buch. Alles nur semantik. Bilder, Vergleiche, Aufgeladener Schrott, nichts was sie auch schon längst benutzt hätte für die Rhetorik der Kunde des heiligen Willens des einen.

  

{PLF}

(die Geduld verlierend)

  

Nichts! So komm ich nicht weiter. So schön es auch ist in Nostalgie zu schwelgen, jetzt muss ich ernst machen.

  

ERZÄHLER:IN (V.O.)

({PLF} ermunternd)

  

Reiss dich zusammen.

{PLF}, schlug das Buch zu.

Verzweifelung machte sich erneut spürbar. Ich werde in diesem Labyrinth nichts mehr finden. Das hier klingt alles überhaupt nicht Zeitgemäß, dachte {PLF} und konnte das Gefühl nicht los werden, daß die von ihr so geliebt Religion nicht mehr die Macht besaß, die sie früher auf ihn auszustrahlen vermochte.

Die Sprache war alt. Sie war alt. Sie fühlte sich alt. Was {PLF} jedoch noch nicht bewusst war an diesem Snapshot, einem Standpunkt in der non-linearität der Zeit, daß oft genau dieser Standpunkt nur alt sein kann, weil eine Person eben da gerade drauf stand und das ist ja logisch gesehen, alt also vergangen ab dem Moment wo die Bewegung einfriert. Ein Änderung des Standpunkts würde ganz neue Türen öffnen. Doch wie lang müßen wir hier {PLF} noch zusehen bis sie begreift, das es Zeit ist. {WOOSH}

  

CHOR 

(hauchte sanft den Chorus von No, he said)

  

Ich musste es tun.

Ich wollte ihn töten.

Ich fing an zu wein'n.

Ich sah' zu ihn.

Im Schatten des Gewölbes flimmerte das Licht flüchtig über ihre glänzenden Augen, die alles sahen, die alles erkannten. Kein Raum war verborgen vor ihr, auch dieser nicht.

Da, am Ende des langen, kalten Ganges, ein Regal. Verstaubt. Schief. Die Bücher darin zu bedeutungslos, um hier wirklich zu sein. Eine Täuschung. Ein Trick. {PLF} wusste, dass sich dahinter mehr verbarg – etwas, das jenseits des Staubs und der Stille atmete. Eine andere Welt, verborgen hinter Papier.

  

Mit einem Blick, wissend und kalt, näherte sie sich. Keine Magie. Keine Geheimnisse. Nur Code. Nur ein Spiel, das darauf wartete, entschlüsselt zu werden.

## INT. INTERAKTIV WANDSENSOR

Eine leise Berührung an einem unscheinbaren Sensor in der Wand. Ihre digitale Pranke legte sich darauf, und sie sprach die Worte – Worte, die den Code knacken sollten:

    "Daten sind.  
  Geschäft ist.  
      Geld ist.  
          Gott."

Das Zischen der Regale klang wie ein ferner Hauch. Sie fuhren zur Seite, und die wahre Kammer lag vor {PLF}. Eine Serverfarm, verborgen unter der Klosterbibliothek. Bildschirme flackerten sanft, blassblaues Licht über die stillen Maschinen, als würde sie selbst atmen, wach und allwissend.

Dies war kein Zufall. Kein Rätsel des Schicksals. Sondern ein digitales Artefakt, platziert, um gefunden zu werden.

## INT. KLOSTER-SERVERFARM-TERMINALS

Dies war es – das Herz der Klosterbibliothek. Ein hochmodernes Kontrollzentrum, getarnt als Ort des Wissens.

Für einen Moment verharrte {PLF}. In den Augen reflektierte das Leuchten der Terminals. Automatisiert schalteten laut Relais beisendes Neonlicht in treibender Frequenz an.

Die Suche nach Antworten hatte hierher geführt, doch es ging schon längst nicht mehr um das bloße Entdecken einfacher Wahrheiten. Die nostalgische Hoffnung, die Vergangenheit zu ergründen, war verflogen. Jetzt ging es darum, die Kontrolle über die Gegenwart – und die Zukunft – zu erlangen. Die Worte der Macht hallten in ihrem Kopf wider: "DATEN SIND MACHT"

Als {PLF} sich näher an das Terminal lehnte, erfüllte eine seltsame Ladung die Luft, die mit unausgesprochener Energie schwirrte. Seine Finger tanzten über die Tastatur, angetrieben von Instinkt und Dringlichkeit. Der Bildschirm leuchtete auf und offenbarte Ablagen mit verschlüsselten Dateien, die auf etwas hinwiesen, das weit über einfache Daten hinausging. Eine Datei erregte seine Aufmerksamkeit: „CATS.MANIFEST“.

Sein Herz raste: C.A.T.S. Cognitive Augmentation and Transcendence System. In dem Dokument wurde die Notwendigkeit beschrieben, eine neue Super Religion zu schaffen.

Das Manifest zielte darauf ab, Glauben, Wissenschaft und himmlische Wesen zu einer neuen Religion zu verschmelzen - einer Religion, die es endlich schaffen würde die Grenzen der Erde zu überschreiten, bereit um den Kosmos zu erobern.

  

        Phase 1: 

  

        Verschmelzung des Bewusstseins von Spieler:innen und ihren Avataren.

Weiter führte der Text an:

  

        Die Menschen haben einen traurigen Entwicklungsstand erreicht, an dem wir es für Möglich erachten und bitten das Kommitee mit größter Notwendigkeit, die von den Menschen entwickleten Technologien mit den unsrigen zu verbinden und empfehlen die Schaffung einer neuen Religion. Die Studie hat ergeben, daß die Vorraussetzungen von einigen Konzernen bereits gesetzt wurden und mit wenigen gut platzierten Spielen und Content, eine Massenhysterie zum gewünschten Effekt binnen weniger Jahre führen sollte. Als Gründe hat die Kommission, genannt, dass für die Verbindung von Avataren mit neuen Bewusstsein, die Vorraussetzung einer Trans notwendig wäre, die angesichts des erstaunlichen Anwachsen von Dauerkonsumierung und Endloser Überbeanspruchung neuraler Prozess durch diverse Formen digitaler und nicht digitaler Rituale bestehen...

Gerade als die Tragweite dieses Experiments deutlich wurde, begann das Terminal wild zu flackern. Codezeilen scrollten dramatisch über den Bildschirm. Eine Warnung erscheint 

         „Vorsicht: Abstoßung des Bewusstseins“.

Ein kalter Schauer überkam {PLF}. {KLACK} Schlagartig war der Raum dunkel. Notlichter sprangen an. Der Schweiss auf {PLF}s Stirn reflektiert sauer-grün.

Unsichtbare Zeichen standen in der Luft. Fragmente eines Rituals. Ein weiterer Kampf stand bevor.

{KLICKER}

{KLICKER KLICKER} Das Geklicker und Geklackert kam näher und wurde immer lauter und kräftiger. Der Vokal formt sich vom i uebers a zum o. Jetzt endlich erkannte {PLF} es.

{KLACKER KLACKER}

Die [[Krähenwesen]], die sie während der Reise schon mehrfach aufsuchten, waren zurück.

{PLF} spürte, wie das Adrenalin durch seine Adern pumpte, während sein Herz wie ein riesiger Schlägel gegen seinen Brustkorb trommelt. Ihre dürren Leiber, ihre langen Schnäbel werfen lange Schatten in die Korridore die an Samurai Schwerter erinnern. Ihre pechschwarzen Augen reflektieren kleine scharfe grüne Punkte. {FLATTER FLATTER} {SWOSH} Mit einem gewaltigen Satz werden die Punkte zu Linien, einer Laserprojektion gleichend, und bewegend in Bruchteil einer Sekunde auf {PLF} zu.

Schnell zog sie ihren Arm zurück, um einem Angriff zu entkommen. Der dabei entstandene Luftsog fröstelt ihre erhitzte Haut.

Die Krähenwesen lachten spöttisch, ihre Stimmen krächzten rau und hallten durch die Hallen.

Ein fauliger Geruch von {PLF}s Angstschweiß mischte sich in die klinische Mischung aus warmer Elektronik, Plastik und kalter, klimatisierter Luft – ein einzigartiger Duft, der könnten Filme riechen bei DEFCON4 ins Kino eingeströmt werden müßte.

## INT. STREAMER STUDIO

  

Cat Pope steht vor der Kamera im Podcast Setup (Video Sequence via QR Code in Print Edition)

{PLF}

Okay, Leute, stellt euch mal die Welt so vor – aber als Geruch. Ja, richtig gehört, heute reden wir über die Vibes, aber nicht visuell, sondern olfaktorisch! 勞

  

Also, lasst uns reinjumpen:

  

🙌 Protestantismus:

Hier geht’s bisschen rougher zu. Keine fancy Räucherstäbchen oder sowas, sondern einfach OG altes Gemäuer und – I kid you not – bisschen nach, naja, Menschsein. Es ist wie so ein ehrlicher, rauer Duft, als ob da einfach der Fokus auf den Basics liegt, versteht ihr? 🪨💧

  

 🤑 Neoliberalismus:

Wenn dieser Vibe ein Raum wär, dann halt so ein klimatisiertes Büro mit ner menge Plastik, Monitore überall und ständig surrende Server. Der Geruch ist irgendwie kalt, voll steril und leicht elektrisch. Es riecht nach Konsum, aber ohne Tiefe, wie so ein neuer Laptop oder die Luft im Apple Store. 🖥️💸

  

🧘 Buddhismus Yoga Selbstoptimierer:

Hier kommt der pure Zen-Modus. Dieser Vibe ist voller Sandelholz und Räucherstäbchen und irgendwie fühlst du dich instant in so nem Peace-Modus. Stell dir vor, du atmest die Natur ein, richtig frische Luft – fast schon so klar, als ob dein Kopf auf "Do Not Disturb" steht. 🍃🌸

  

 📲 TikTok-Streamer:

Yeah, der Geruch ist – let’s be real – eine wilde Mischung! Plastik und Elektronik durch die ganzen Lichter, Make-up und so’n bisschen süßes Parfüm gemixt mit Fast-Food vibes. Es ist wie das Leben zwischen Likes und Chips, alles leicht chaotisch, aber auch kinda awesome. ✌️🍟✨

  

 ☪️ Islam:

Jetzt wird’s deep, Freunde. Der Vibe hier ist Moschus und Oud – so ein warmer, erdiger Duft, der dich irgendwie grounding bringt. Da ist so eine subtile Note von Rosenwasser und diese Frische, die einfach clean und echt rüberkommt. Pure Ehrfurcht, Leute. 🌹🙏

  

Okay, das war’s erstmal – was denkt ihr, nach was riecht euer Vibe?  Schreibt's mir in die Kommentare!

## INT. FORTSETZUNG KAMPF IM SERVERRAUM

{PLF} wich in die Ecke aus. Ein weiter Angriff steht bevor.

Ihre Hände zitterten, als sie sich an das Kamehameha erinnerte, die einzige Möglichkeit zur Rettung, die ihr wohl blieb. Aufgeben? Niemals! dachte sie verzweifelt, als sie sich mit aller Kraft zusammenriss und ihre Energie kanalisierte. Der Kälte des Raumes wich ein warmer Schimmer, als sie ihre Hände hob und mit einem lauten Schrei den Angriff entfesselte. Die Energie des Kamehameha raste durch die Luft und erfüllte den Raum mit einer flirrenden Spannung. Transistoren und LEDs fingen plötzlich an, in intensiven Farben zu glühen, als ob sie die übernatürliche Kraft nicht nur leiteten, sondern sie in einem letzten, elektrisierenden Tanz feierten. Ihre Lichter pulsierten, blitzten auf, und die Gerätschaften schienen für einen Moment zu leben. Dann, in einem unermesslich grellen Licht, erreichte die Energie ihren Höhepunkt. Für einen Augenblick schien die Zeit stillzustehen, bevor alles in sich zusammenbrach – das Licht erlosch, die Maschinen verstummten, und die Farm versank in tiefer, unheimlicher Stille.

Die Krähenwesen schrien laut auf, flatterten panisch umher und verschwanden im Dunkel. Dieser Kampf war gewonnen, dachte {PLF}, während sie sich mühsam durch den finsteren Serverraum schleppte. Die flackernden, stillgelegten Bildschirme und Kabelsalate um sie herum wirkten wie ein kaltes, technisches Grab. Der metallische Geruch von Überhitzung lag schwer in der Luft. Doch sie wusste, dass es noch nicht vorbei war.

Mit letzter Kraft entdeckte sie eine Tür am Ende des Raumes, die wie der Eingang zu einer Gruft wirkte. Keuchend stemmte sie sich dagegen, bis diese knirschend nachgab und {PLF} ins Freie stolperte. Vor ihr breitete sich der Friedhof aus, der Geruch von feuchter Erde und verwesenden Blättern pochte in der Luft. Ein bitterer, stiller Sieg – doch sie wusste, kein Triumph kommt ohne Preis. Doch was war der Preis? Was steckte hinter den geheimen Repositories? Ein neues Testament? Projekt Elysium?

# 4. Song

NO HE SAID

1. Strophe  
No.  
he said.  
"No," he said.  
"no," I said.  
"I know," she said.  
"Thank you," she said.  
"Come with me," she said.  
"Talk to me," she said.  
"Don't worry about it," she said.

It made me want to cry.  
no one had seen him since.  
it made me feel uneasy.  
no one had seen him.

the thought made me smile.  
the pain was unbearable.  
the crowd was silent.

the old man called out.  
the old man said.  
the man asked.

He was silent for a long moment.  
he was silent for a moment.  
it was quiet for a moment.  
it was dark and cold.  
And then there was a pause.

2. Strophe  
It was my turn.  
There was no one else in the world.  
There was no one else in sight.  
They were the only ones who mattered.  
They were the only ones left.  
He had to be with me.  
She had to be with him.

Chorus  
(solo)  
I had to do this.  
I wanted to kill him.  
I started to cry.  
I turned to them.  
(tutti)  
They had to do this  
They wanted to kill him  
They started to cry  
They turned to them

  
  

# 7. Kapitel

DER FRIEDHOF

## INT./EXT. AUS DER GRUFT

{PLF} trat aus der Gruft hinaus, die Dunkelheit noch in seinen Gedanken nachhallend, und stand nun inmitten der gespenstischen Stille des Friedhofs. Der Kampf mit den Krähenwesen hatte ihn schwer gezeichnet, nicht nur äußerlich. Ihr boshaftes Lachen, als sie sich zurückzogen, hallte noch immer in seinen Ohren. Sie wussten etwas, das ihm verborgen blieb. Der Sieg fühlte sich hohl an, als hätte sie nur einen kleinen Teil eines viel größeren, ungreifbaren Ganzen errungen.

Der Himmel war klar, doch die Realität um sie herum flackerte wie ein gestörter Bildschirm. Es waren kleine, fast unmerkliche Verzerrungen, die ihr das Gefühl gaben, in einer Welt gefangen zu sein, die nicht ganz real war. Ein Glitch, ein Fehler im Gewebe der Wirklichkeit, der ihm immer wieder das Gefühl gab, nicht mehr zu wissen, was wahr war und was nicht.

Das Sonnenlicht, das ihre Haut wärmte, beruhigte die Nerven für einen kurzen Moment. Doch die Störungen blieben, kleine Sprünge in seiner Wahrnehmung, als ob Teile der Umgebung plötzlich verschwanden und an anderer Stelle wieder auftauchten. Der Friedhof selbst wirkte wie eine digitale Illusion, ein Ort, der in der nächsten Sekunde zusammenbrechen könnte.

## EXT. VERGEBENE JAGDT EINER ALTEN FREUNDIN ÜBER DEN FRIEDHOF

{PLF} begann ihre Erkundung, aber die Glitches erschwerten die Suche. Die Realität schien sich willkürlich zu verschieben. Ein Grabstein, gerade noch da. Verschwunden. Die Umrisse von Bäumen flackerten, als ob sie in verschiedene Dimensionen versetzt würden. Zwischen den flimmernden Szenen tauchte immer wieder die Spynx-Katze auf, ein seltsames Wesen, das wie eine lebende Anomalie wirkte. Sie schien mit den Glitches zu verschmelzen, blitzte an verschiedenen Stellen des Friedhofs auf, verschwand und erschien erneut, als würde sie durch die Fehler im System hindurchgleiten.

Verwirrt und zunehmend verunsichert versuchte {PLF}, der Katze zu folgen. Tief in den Friedhof führte die Jagd. Jeder Versuch, näher an sie heranzukommen, wurde durch weitere Glitches unterbrochen. Der Boden schien zu ruckeln. Bereits sie an einen anderen Ort zu transportieren, nur um Sekundenbruchteile später zurück zuspringen. Nichts hier folgte den Regeln der normalen Welt.

Dann, inmitten dieser Störsignale, machte {PLF} eine Entdeckung. Furcht überkam sie. Beim Lesen der Grabstein Insignien spürte sie, wie die Störungen sich verdichteten. Die Lettern verschwammen vor den Augen. Da standen keine Namen – nur Funktionen! Rollen in einer grotesken Hierarchie. 

   „Wächter:in“,  
„Krieger:in“,  
„Berater:in“,  
"Influencer",  
"AI Ethiker:in". 

  

  Kein einziger Name, keine Identität. Nur Positionen, wie in einem undurchdringlichen System.

Angsterfühlt lief sie hastig weiter. Die Hoffnung, Gräber zu finden, die mehr verraten würden. Die Glitches wurden intensiver. Die Realität selbst reagierte in diesem Moment reagierte. 

Schließlich waren da die Gräber der Kirchenpatriarchen. Doch die Glitches wurden immer stärker und ruckelten an der Darstellung der Realität. Wieder keine Namen – nur ein einziges Wort. Immer und immer wieder. {PLF}s Befürchtung wurde bestätigt „Pope“ – immer und immer wieder. Keine Unterscheidung, keine Geschichte. Nur Titel. Als ob diese Menschen niemals existiert hätten. Als Individuen ausgelöscht. Selbst ihre Titel schienen sich inmitten der Glitches zu verändern. „CEO“, "Guru", „Moderator:in“, „Thought Leader:in“, „Startup-Gründer:in“. Titel, die nicht nur alt, sondern auch modern und aus der digitalen Welt stammten, als hätte die Hierarchie des Systems sich über die Jahrhunderte hinweg einfach nur angepasst. Der Friedhof war keine Ruhestätte – er war ein lebendiges Archiv, eine gespenstige Vision der Welt, in der Individualität längst durch Funktionen und Rollen ersetzt worden waren.

## EXT. AM BRUNNEN

{PLF}’s Atem ging schneller. Sie eilte zu einem Brunnen um Wasser zu trinken. Doch alles begann immer heftiger zu ruckeln. Die Glitches wurden zu regelrechten Rissen in seiner Wahrnehmung durch die ein zweite durchschimmerte. Ein Wassertropfen erhob sich aus dem Becken. Er erinnerte an die Kugel die {PLF} in den Berge gesehen hatte. Während die Wasserkugel intakt blieb, schien sich die Struktur des Friedhofs jedoch zu verschieben. Die gesamte Szene wurde instabil. Der Boden flackerte. Ein unheimliches, verzerrtes Rascheln, das klang wie ein beschädigter Ton in einem gestörten Video.

{PLF} wusste, dass etwas Schreckliches angestossen wurde. Sie war der Auslößer. Doch bevor {PLF} einen klaren Gedanken fassen konnte, verzog sich die Welt erneut, und alles begann sich zu bewegen. Die Zeit selbst war nun gegen sie gestellte.

Die Welt löschte sich aus. Unwirklichkeiten. Bäume und Grabsteine verschwanden, tauchten wieder auf. Verzerrt. Wild rotierend. Das Gewebe der Realität selbst zerriss.

{MIAAAAAAAAUUUUU} 

Plötzlich erklang ein langgezogenes Miauen – ein vertrauter Klang inmitten des Wahnsinns. {PLF} erstarrte, sein Kopf ruckte in die Richtung des Geräuschs. Dort, am Rande des Sichtfeldes, stand die Sphynx-Katze, ihre goldenen Augen blitzten im flackernden Licht. Ein Aura umgab sie. Ihre schlanke Silhouette schien sich nicht von den umgebenden Verzerrungen beeinflussen zu lassen. Sie wirkte fest und real, während alles andere flüchtig und brüchig war. Meditierte sie? Schwebte Sie?

{MIAAAUUU} 

Ein weiteres, tieferes Miauen kam von der Katze, dieses Mal klang es dringlich. Einladend. Die Erscheinung kam aus Richtung eines verwitterten Tors am Rand des Friedhofs – ein Tor, das {PLF} zuvor kaum beachtet hatte, wieso auch, dachte sie doch noch antworten zu finde. Es schien einen Garten zu führen. 

{PLF} spürte, dies war der einzige Ausweg. Überall sonst hatten die Glitches bereits fast alles verschlungen. Das Miauen der Katze schnitt durch die verzerrten Geräusche, und der Garten jenseits des Tors wirkte seltsam unberührt. Dort schien die Realität intakt zu bleiben.

Ein letzter Blick auf den zerfallenden Friedhof.

{SCHNURR} 

Das Schnurren bildete eine Brücke die in einem Gartentor endete. Mit letzter Kraft. Buchstabe für Buchstabe gelingt es {PLF} sich hinein zu zerren.

GARTEN EDEN

## EXT. GARDEN EDEN IM SONNEN UNTERGANG

{PLF}

(grübelte)

Wie konnte es sein, dass alles gerade noch so desolat,

so fatalistisch,

so überweltigend (sic) war,

Ich schien zu fallen.

Und nun steck ich fest.

Ich auf sanftem Festen Boden?

Wie mit sanften Pfoten.

Oben ist wieder unten?

Nunja, die Hände im Dreck haben mich für einen Moment zum, wie nannten sie es in Russland nochmal? Quadrobiing, also zu einem Quadrant gemacht.

{PLF} (O.S.)

(kommandierte eine unterbewußte Stimme)

  

Neuverordnen!

Zeit für ein Bodyscan!

5-4-3-3-2! Action!

{PLF}

(stöhnt überrascht)

{Uff}

Dies war eines von der Therapeutin empfohlen Bewältigungsmechanismen im Falle einer Sinnflut. Nicht austrocknen, sondern sich selbst im Chaos fühlen lernen.

{Pah} Heut morgen schien alles noch so In Ord Nung, dachte sich {PLF}. Dann die ganze Tortur, wilde Wesen, Angriffe, Bücher, die ich noch nie gesehen habe? Erklär mir bitte mal wer wieso hier kein Schnee mehr liegt?, raste es durch das Gehirn von {PLF}.

{PLF} (O.S.)

(von allen Seiten vom Chor verstärkt)

  

Augen auf!

  

{PLF} begann mit der Übung.

{PLF}

  

5 Dinge die ich sehe!

Während {PLF} durch die von der Abendsonne durchzogene Beetreihen streifte fing sie an mechanisch aufzuzählen. Tomatenstauden, Thymian, Baby Chili Paprika, krokodilsartigen OBI Gießkannen und aufgebockte Wasserspeicher aus - nunja, beinahe Yves Klein-blauem - Plastik.

  

{PLF} (cont'd)

(triumphierend)

Check. 4 Dinge hören.

  

{PLF} (cont'd)

(langsam umherstreifend, die Ohren gespitzt)

  

Ruhe. Endlich würde es Ruhe. Okay, dass kann gezählt werden. 

Zweitens, ein Windspiel aus leichten holen Holzstäben {BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK} in einiger Entfernung. Drittens, ... {PLF} konzentrierte sich, schloß die Augen. Atmetete tief ein. {BRIZZZZZZZZZZ} Das satte Brummen einer Hochspannungsleitung! {BSSSSS} Da sauste eine Fliege an {PLF}s Ohr schnell vor rüber. Das Summen würde langsam tiefer. Was ein Dopplereffekt und tolles Stereo, dachte sich {PLF}. Viertens. Check!

Verwundert schaute eine Meise mit Wurm von ihrem Ast dem Treiben lautlos zu.{???}

3 Dinge spüren. {PLF} streckte beide Arme weit aus, die Augen noch geschloßen. Obwohl die Sonne bereits mit einem Bein im Grab stand für heute bemerkte {PLF} ihre radioaktiven Strahlen genau. Es brannte ein wenig, doch nicht unbedingt unangenehm. Erstens, check. Durch ihre Finger glitten hochgewachsene Gräser und kitzelten sie behutsam an Unterarm und Ellenbogen. Check. {PLF} zog die Arme zurück zum Körper und fühlte den Stoff der edlen Garbadine. Mit den Fingerkuppen konnte sie jeden Faden und deren Richtung genaustens ertasten. Welch Ordnung! Welch Perfektion! dachte sich {PLF} CHECK, das waren die drei.

{SCHNUFF SCHNUFF} 

Riechen genau. Grün. Grasig, Erfrischen. Okay. Ein Gemüse, dass nach einer Farbe riecht? Ha, Brechbohne triumphierte {PLF}. Zweitens, hier riecht es nach Humus. Check. Saftige kompostierte Erde. Nun fehlte {PLF} nur noch der letzte Sinn. Das Schmecken. Es war bitter. Glutamat artig, ein wenig wie altes Fleisch jedoch. {BÄH}

{PLF} spuckt und reißt die Augen auf. Vor ihr eine Pfütze. In der Reflektion erkannte {PLF} die Katzer wieder. Du bist es? Aber wie kann das sein? ... {PLF} starrte Regungslos in die Pfütze und langsam beginnt der geerdete Geist zu verstehen. Jetzt, machte alle Sinn. {PLF} fehlte die Kraft sich weiter zu währen. Es sollte ja doch nichts mehr helfen. 

{PLF} (cont'd)

(mit einem Säufzen)

  

???????????????

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ich war die Katze!

5. Song

  

LIKE A BABY

  

My father called

I was still asleep

He told me they are bombing the airport

I could not believe it at first

I would not believe it at first

  

Through the hard times and the good

Through the hard times and the good

Through the hard times and the good

Through the hard times and the good

Through the hard times and the good

Through the hard times and the good

  

But then I heard the jets

And I was terrified

I felt like a baby

I felt like a baby

  

A feeling like you can not protect yourself

Stick with rational people when things fall apart!

  

Chorus

Everyone brought their cats.

Everyone brought their cat.

Everyone brought their cat.

Everyone brought their cat.

  

And I was terrified

I felt like a baby

I felt like a baby

I felt like a baby

  

Through the hard times and the good

Through the hard times and the good

Wir sehen wir Katzenpabst in einer Traumszene durch eine Welt schweift als Katze, im Kloster, Gejagt, im Schnee, Im Kampf, In einer Einstürzenden Bibliothek, einem Friedhof. Und wir sehen wie Katzenpabst sich versucht mit Exorcismus selbst den Dämonen auszutreiben. 
Nach dem gescheiterten Versuch jedoch gibt, Katzenpabst auf und gibt sich dem Katze sein hin. Leckt sich die Pfoten und legt sich gemütlich auf den Boden. 

Dazu erklingt die Musik von [[Roar Little Kitty 🐯]]

KATZEN PABST  
DAS ERWACHEN
  
1.Kapitel  
EIN NEUER TAG,  
EIN ALTES SPIEL!

## Abstract

Ein ungebetener Gast schien die Ruhe der Morgenrituale des Katzenpapstes zerstören zu wollen. 

## Script

INT. Schlafzimmer

*In der Nacht*

Die Musik von [[Roar Little Kitty 🐯]] endete abrupt. {PLF} erwachte aus einem grausamen Alptraum. Schweißüberzogen saß {PLF} im Bett, wir sahen die angsterfüllten Augen.

PABST-ÄHNLICHE FIGUR *schrie* 

MAMA! WTF?!

{PLF} kniff sich.

Puh! Es war nur ein Traum.

{PLF} schlief wieder ein.

EXT. Apartment

*Sonnenaufgang über brutalistischen Wohnblock*

ERZÄHLER:IN

An jedem Morgen ging die Sonne auf, so war es geschrieben. Es verschob sich, das wussten wir, je nach Stellung der Erde zur Sonne, und wenn es regnete oder zuviel Nebel gab, dann konnten wir dennoch sicher sein, dass es dahinter, seit Beginn der Zeit, dasselbe kosmische Ritual war. Auf Schatten folgte das Licht, und das Licht war das Leben, und mit dem Leben begann auch der Tag unserer {PLF}.

*Zoom auf Apartment*

{KLINGEL}

ERZÄHLER:IN

Um dennoch sicherzugehen, dass dieser Tag auch funktionieren konnte, hatte sich unsere {PLF} einen Wecker gestellt, einen digitalen mit Atomuhrverbindung.  

*WERBUNG*

Natürliches Vertrauen auf kosmische Präzision und traditionelles Handwerk. Natürlich von Schaffhausen. Bestellt euch euren Chronomat unter diesem Promo-Link mit 20% Rabatt https://promo.pocketpreacher.com/?code=schaffhause) Denn nur der frühe Vogel fängt den Wurm.

ERZÄHLER:IN

Da es für predigende Wesen die Verantwortung war, vor der Gemeinde zu erscheinen und die nötigen eigenen Rituale vor denen der Gemeind(en) zu absolvieren, gehörte es eben dazu, und machte unserer {PLF} absolut nichts aus.

{KLINGELINGELING}

ERZÄHLER:IN fuhr fort

Dennoch, unsere {PLF} war geübt darin, dieses Ringen gekonnt zu ignorieren. Ja, sie war geübt in der Technik des lucid dreamings, einer Methode, in der der Schlummerzustand genutzt werden konnte, um die eigenen Träume zu steuern. Eine wahnsinnig spannende Methode; es war, als erlebte und schrieb man gleichzeitig einen Film in aller Realität. Ein unbeschreibliches Gefühl der Macht. Mit dieser Fähigkeit ausgestattet, verwandelte {PLF} das Klingeln in einen Triller, der sich in den Goa-Soundtrack eines DMT-Trips verwandelte, eine Sirene, die sich aufbaute und stabilisierte und eine engelhorngleiche Schicht in den Raum zeichnete, die die Wolken zum Schwingen brachte.

*Papst-ähnliche Figur in noch menschlicher Gestalt lag im Bett.*

*Eine Sphynx-Katze tauchte an der Tür zum Schlafzimmer auf. Sichtlich genervt und abgekühlt, sprang sie auf den Nachttisch und versetzte dem schallenden Gerät einen heftigen Schlag. Es schepperte auf den Boden. Die {PLF} schreckte auf und war wach.*

*Sillouette der papst-ähnlichen Figur vor dem Fenster. Sie starrte aus dem Fenster in den Sonnenaufgang.*

*Nahaufnahme des Gesichts.*

{PLF}

Ich hasse Montag ... (TM Garfield)

*{PLF} schleppte sich müde aus dem Schlafzimmer durch den Korridor in Richtung Küche.*

Zuerst zur Küche. Eiweiß!  

*{PLF} schlug gekonnt zwei Eier synchron in einer Pfanne auf.*

{ZISCH ZISCH ZISCH KNACKS BRZZZ ZISCH ZISCH}  

{PLF} dachte:

Nunja, ist bissi populistisch, aber taugt gut zum Geschichten erzählen.  

{PLF} las weiter:

… er machte drei Ringe und gab jeden einem Sohn?

Ah, das war eine tolle Metapher dafür, dass es nicht nur einen wahren Glauben gibt! Interessante, aber gefährliche Worte. Ich fragte mich, ob jemand meine Gedanken las, während ich diese Erzählung ergründete. Wer bestimmte die Wahrheit, und wer erhielt die Schlüssel zu den Geschichten, die ich erzählen wollte? Wo lag der Unterschied zwischen meinem Wollen und dem, was ich für andere inszenierte? Wem sollte ich dienen, wenn nicht drei Herren, der perfekten Dreieinigkeit des Chaos?

{SCHWUPP PLÄTSCHER}

*Plötzliche Wendung. In der Luft waren Bremsspuren zu sehen. {PLF} ging mit halb geschlossenen Augen ins Bad. Sie nahm ein Buch in die Hand und setzte sich zum Kacken hin.*

*Das Buch hieß: „Das Dekameron“*

ERZÄHLER:IN

Natürlich hatte die Lektüre länger gedauert, als {PLF} es wahrhaben wollte. {PLF} neigte oft dazu, sich im Text zu verlieren. Eingesaugt, als wäre {PLF} selbst die Magd auf dem Scheiterhaufen.

*Geräusche im Hintergrund*
{FRY FRY FRY ZISCH}

{PLF} sinnierte:

Ein Fetisch? Eine Show? Wollte ich nur unterhalten?

*"Let me entertain you" Melodie von Robbie Williams spielte im Hintergrund*

Nein, es ging hier um mehr als die Metapher! Ich wollte ein Feuer entzünden bei den Leuten. Mit mir brennen sollten ihre Emotionen.

{FRY FRY FRY ZISCH}

Oh, shit!

*Schneller Abgang in die Küche*

{BRZZZ BRZZZ BRZZZ ZISCH}

{PLF}

Holy Moly, Guacamole! Meine Eier! {GRRR}

*{PLF} nahm die Pfanne und warf die verbrannten Eier direkt in den Mülleimer.*

{PATSCH PLUMPS}

Egal, ich ess später einfach ein paar Oblaten. Es gab Wichtigeres.

ERZÄHLER:IN

Vorm Waschbecken angekommen, ergriff {PLF} die Paste – das blaue Elixier extrudierte heraus.

{QUETSCH, PLOMP}

{PLF}

Verfehlt? WTF! Scheint ja gar nix mehr zu klappen.

ERZÄHLER:IN

Der zweite Versuch gelang …

{PLF} zürnte genervt Richtung Erzähler:in:

Danke, aber WIR haben es verstanden. Ruhe, jetzt, ich konzentriere mich.

ERZÄHLER:IN

… und {PLF} begann zu bürsten. Beim Hin und Her der Bürste. {FRAP FRAP FRAP FRAP} starrte {PLF} in die tiefen Augenringe. {PLF} schien durch sich selbst hindurchzusehen, spuckte ins Becken {SPLAT} und starrte erneut mit irrem Blick in den Spiegel.

{PLF} erschrak:

{ARRRRR}

Was ist das?

{PLF} rieb sich die Augen und doch…

Es war da wer-was/wessen, ein Wesen!  

Ein Katzenvieh? Im Bademantel?

ERZÄHLER:IN

Nichts mehr! Wie es erschien, war es auch wieder weg.

{PLF}

Naja, gut, weg ist sie, war wohl nur Einbildung.

CHOR

Once it means Nothing.

ERZÄHLER:IN

Sorgsam und mit geübter Hand glitt die {PLF} in die feine Garbadine, deren schlichtes, reines Weiß eine gewisse Eleganz ausstrahlte. Den meisten würde es nicht auffallen, doch die Garbadine, mit ihrer diagonal gerippten Struktur, lag straff am Körper an. Oft wurde sie zu Unrecht als gewöhnlich abgetan, doch sie unterschied sich wesentlich von der Popeline, die leichter und quergerippt war. Jetzt nur keine weiteren Ablenkungen: Was {PLF} an diesem Ritual so liebte, war, dass es die Kraft hatte, die Seele so glatt und rein wie die Nähte am Korsett werden zu lassen. {PLF} liebte dieses Ritual. Das Binden der Schnüre, das Falten der Ärmel – alles saß. Es war eine millimetergenaue Maßanfertigung, die {PLF}s androidenhafte Gestalt glänzen ließ. Der Einstieg in die Rolle:

{PLF}

Nein, eine Rolle war es nicht mehr. Die Philosoph:innen stritten sich über Identität. Es war eine Berufung!

ERZÄHLER:IN

Ja, da war die Spiritualität/Theologie überlegen. Endlich durchströmte {PLF} das am heutigen Tag so lange auf sich warten lassende Selbstbewusstsein. {PLF} war bereit und schritt in den Flur hinaus.

{PING}

Die Fahrstuhltür öffnete sich.

Mit dem Lift fuhr {PLF} vom Penthouse hinunter. {RATTER RATTER}

*ANIMATION UND FADE OUT*

{PLF} schritt aus dem Haus. Die Aufsicht ins Gesicht, das Gebäude im Hintergrund.

 Aus dem Schwarz des Himmels tauchte die Figur auf.

{PLF} dachte:

Es dämmerte noch!

Was für ein mächtiges blaues Licht war das, das durch die Korridore des brutalistischen Gebäudes strahlte?

Es war mein Raumschiff!  
Vor 54 Jahren, 5 Stunden, 15 Minuten war ich mit dir hier auf diesem Planeten angekommen! Ich erinnerte mich genau, das Jahr, in dem Mao Zedong und Ulrike Meinhof zum Herren aufgestiegen waren. Sie hatten es nicht anders verdient. Sie waren schwer zu interpretierende und mit doppeltem Blick zu betrachtende Personen. Eine Jugend ohne Gott. Selber wollten sie wohl zu Göttern werden. Na wenigstens hatten sie etwas durchgezogen.

ERZÄHLER:IN

Klar, es wäre schon eine gute Geschichte, oder nicht? Science Fiction passte nun einfach gut zum Selbstbild von {PLF}.

{FAUCH}

{PLF}

Da bist du ja wieder?

*Bereits auf der Schwelle zur Treppe tauchte die Katze erneut im Gang auf. Sie schaute {PLF} aufsässig an.*

*Sofort wedelte {PLF} mit den langen Gliedern.*

{WHIP WHIP} Hau ab! Zieh Leine! Geh du Untier! Und hässlich bist du auch. OMG!

{SWOSH} *Das Katzengetier zog sich zurück, als hätte es die Schatten der Realität überschritten, und wirbelte dabei eine Wolke aus Staub auf. In diesem Moment der Abwehr überkam {PLF} ein Gefühl. Sie wurden erinnert an die dystopischen Held:innen aus all den Erzählungen, von Sci-Fi bis hin zu den tiefen der heiligen Texte – Held:innen, die zuerst gegen ihre inneren Dämonen kämpfen mussten, um in einer starren Welt ihre wahre Identität zu finden. Noch wusste {PLF} nicht, wie sehr dieser Kampf nun auch Teil ihrer eigenen Reise werden würde.*

*{PLF} ging weiter und schritt durch die meandernden Wege der Siedlung wie Moses auf einem Hoverboard durchs Rote Meer. Dabei summten sie leise den Chorus des Liedes der heutigen Predigt vor sich hin: "I want to be a cloud, loud, loud, loud!" Wie ein Sonnenstrahl antwortete der Chor durch die dichten Wolken mit „loud loud loud“, und es wurde langsam heller.*

2.Kapitel  
DAS HAUS VERLASSEN

## Abstract

Noch verstört von der Begegnung machte sich der Katzenpabst auf den Weg, nur um feststellen zu müssen, dass die Außenwelt gefährlicher – und verführerischer – war als erwartet.

## Script

EXT. *Zwischen den Apartmentblocks.
früh am Morgen.

 Die grauen, kathedralenartigen Gebäude ragten hoch in den Himmel und warfen schattenreiche Höhlen auf die von Regen glänzenden Gehwege. Ein Farbenspiel löste den monotonen Drone-Chor des Alltags ab, während {PLF} gemächlich zwischen den Betonriesen flanierte.*

INTERAKTIVES Kapitel

*Wir verfolgten {PLF} beim Flanieren durch die Gegend. {PLF} schien nicht in Eile zu sein und nahm hier und da Umwege. Es folgte eine Abfolge von Szenen, wie ein Erkunden in einem Computerspiel. Jede Szene war ein Schauplatz, in den {PLF} eintrat, kurz dachte, sich umsah, kommentierte oder einfach nur verweilte.*

*Die Szenen verhielten sich wie das Erkunden in einem Computerspiel. Neue Räume wurden entdeckt. Jeder Raum hatte eine andere Soundstimmung, es konnten Ungereimtheiten auftreten bei Anschlüssen, jedoch faded jeweils die Szene ein und aus. Kein Raum war langweilig. Mittelalterliche, urbane und brutalistische Räume wechselten sich ab.*

*Ein Randomizer wiederholte gewisse Räume beim Scrollen. Der Algorithmus merkte sich die Reihenfolge der Räume in einer Raumhistory.*

*Am Anfang und Ende des Raumes tauchten Buttons auf*

3.Kapitel  
PREDIGT

## Abstract

Die Gemeinde versammelte sich, ahnungslos gegenüber der drohenden Dunkelheit. Während der Katzenpabst predigte, näherte sich eine unheilvolle Präsenz, die von allen gespürt, aber von niemandem gesehen wurde.

## Script

*EXT. Kathedrale.*

{PLF} kam mit großen Schritten an, beeindruckt wie üblich von der prächtigen, jahrhundertealten Architektur. Gekleidet in Gewänder, die mit der Schönheit des Tempels konkurrierten, durchströmte {PLF} Stolz. Ein Gefühlscocktail aus Ehrfurcht, Stolz, Macht und Bestätigung erfüllte {PLF}. Man sah es {PLF} an: die ganze Statur war aufgestreckt, jedes Glied stützte die Bögen, der Körper war kein organisches Gebilde aus Proteinen und Kohlenstoff mehr, sondern ein Geist, der zu schweben schien aus kosmischer Materie, erst in der Bewegung manifestiert. Die Einsicht, die Zuversicht, mit der {PLF} das Gewand an diesen Ort trug, vervollständigte das Ganze. Diese Kleider waren gemacht von Leuten für mächtige Leute. 

INT. Kathedrale

ERZÄHLER:IN

Doch ...

*Müde Gesichter, gelangweiltes Gemurmel, ab und zu knipst ein Fotoapparat. Kein Mensch Bemerkte. Die strahlende Grinsen von {PLF} verzog sich und der Mund klappte auf.*

PABST-ÄHNLICHE FIGUR *verwundert*

{HÄÄ?} {KRATZ} Wieso steht ihr da so rum und glotzt in eure Handies? Seid wann ist das hier n PokeStop? Alles nutzlose Styropor Kids. Manchmal versteh ich wirklich nicht wieso  die meisten von Ihnen überhaupt hier herkommen. Bei den Touristen noch weniger. Nunja, das ist der Job!

ERZÄHLER:IN

So war es: es war Job, es war Berufung, nichts konnte {PLF} hier auf dieser Bühne, extra für {PLF} entworfen, aus der Fassung bringen. {PLF} war sich sicher. Von solch einer Inszenierung konnten Taylor Swift und selbst Donald Trump nur träumen… Es waren eben die großen Weltreligionen, die das Ritual perfektioniert, wenn nicht erfunden hatten.

*Im Innenraum angekommen, ging {PLF} direkt auf einen Altar zu. Ein paar vereinzelte Gesichter starrten {PLF} über ihr Handy mittelmäßig interessiert an. 

KIND:IN *stupste ihre Tante an.*

Guck mal, Tante. Die Katze ist ganz nackt! 

FRAU schaut kurz vom Handy auf

{SHRUG} Ja, mag so sein. Komisches Ding.

{PLF} stützte sich mit beiden Vorderläufen auf. Senkte das Haupt und hielt für einen Moment inne, bevor sie die Predigt begann. Auf diesen Moment kam es an!*

{ROARRRRRRRRRRR} Ein gewaltiger Schrei schepperte durch das riesige Kirchenschiff. Das Kind erschrickt und schlug beim Versuch sich um die Tante zu klammern dieser das Handy mit ganzer Wucht aus der Hand. {WHUP} {KLING KLONG} {SCHEPPER}. Jetzt erstaunen alle. 

DIVERSE SPRACHFETZEN

Wo kam, dass her? 

Ein Tiger? 

Ein Wolf?

KIND

Ich hab Angst. {ZITTER}

Es dauert noch einem Moment, bis auch das letzte Fünkchen Lärm in der Luft Zeit zum Abrieseln hatt. {RASCHEL} Die Buchstaben des {ROARRRRRRRR} segelten wie kleine Fallschirme zu Boden. {PLF} holte tief Luft um das explosive Crescendo der Predigt zu entfesseln.

Schneller Richtungswechsel, dynamische Verschmelzung der Bewegungen mit dem Raum, der Worte mit den Gliedern, die mit Feuer und Flamme artikulierten, die Wörter trugen wie Ninja-Sterne, sogenannte Shuriken, die nicht nur Waffen, sondern auch Nachrichten waren. In alle Richtungen reflektierte die perfekte Akustik die Wörter, sie schlugen auf und durch die Trommelfelle, das Mark, die Kleinhirnrinde, mit der Kraft tausender MDMA-Trips. 

1.Strophe
*Neuer Tag, neues Spiel*
*Mein Pfad, meine Mission.*
*An meine Wand schlage ich Trophäen,*
*Aller meiner Siege*
*Kocht mich auf, verdampfet mich*
*Meinen Körper zu feinsten Tröpfchen.*
*Diese schweren Glieder taugen meiner Absicht nicht!*
*Hebt mich empor in die Herrlichkeit des Himmels*

Chorus
*Ich wär so gern eine Cloud, laut, laut, laut.*
*Lass uns ziehen wie eine Cloud, laut, laut, laut.*
*Einmal nur eine Cloud, laut, laut, laut.*
*Für immer wär ich stolz, stolz, stolz, stolz.* 

Diese schnellen Folgen wurden kurzfristig unterbrochen vom Flüstern der Worte "laut, laut, laut" am Ende des Choruses. {PLF} war begabt in der Nutzung der Dynamik und brach sofort nach dem Verhallen des letzten leisen Atems mit voller Kraft in die erste Zeile der nächsten Strophe.

*Mein Körper gehört mir, besteht er doch aus anderen,*

ERZÄHLER:IN

{MIAU}

PABST-ÄHNLICHE FIGUR *entdeckte die Katze zwischen den Betbänken und verschluckte sich*

... ? Wirklich? Schon wieder?

*{PLF} verlor komplett die Konzentration, der Chor sang unbeirrt weiter, laut, laut, laut. So wichtig war das Dirigat nun wohl doch nicht.*

*{PLF} wird schwindlig und sie taumelte durch den Gang.*

PABST-ÄHNLICHE FIGUR

Das kann nicht die Realität sein, die ich mir heute ausgesucht habe.

{PLF} Gestiguliert nach oben. Bitte, Vater. Nicht jetzt!

Welcher Satan hat dich geschickt?

Geh! Hau ab!

*Ein Katz-und-Maus-Spiel begann, und {PLF} versuchte verzweifelt, die Katze zu fangen. Die anfängliche Würde war weg, die Balken der Bögen des kosmischen Gerüstes bogen sich, die Statur wirkte knotig, ungelenk, wie ein zerknittertes Tuch, ein zusammengestürztes Kartenhaus, die faltigen Augenlider eines Minenarbeiters, die Falten der Mutter Teresa, ein Mikadospiel, als wäre ein Tornado plötzlich in das Gotteshaus eingefahren und hätte eine Spur der Verwüstung hinterlassen.*

ERZÄHLER:IN

Doch es gelang {PLF} nicht, den Störenfried zu fangen.

*Nach einer Weile entschied {PLF}, dass es zu viel wurde. An ein Zurückgehen zum Chor, an eine Fortsetzung motivierender, tragender, wichtiger Worte war nicht zu denken. Es herrschte nicht nur ein Tornado im Raum, sondern auch im Kopf von {PLF}. Die ganze Morgenroutine, das Meditieren, das Sinnieren, das Konzentrieren – alles war mit einem Mal weg. {PLF} entschied sich schnell, das Weite zu suchen. In diesem Zustand durfte die Gemeinde, geschweige denn der Chor, {PLF} nicht sehen. Verzweifelt? Verloren? Wegen einer Katze? Auf keinen Fall!*

PABST-ÄHNLICHE FIGUR

Das ist zu viel. Schnell weg hier.

*{PLF} flüchtet durch das Hauptportal in Richtung U-Bahn. Passant:innen im nicht enden wollenden Strom aus Gläubigen, Tourist:innen und Styroporkinder werden zurückgestoßen und erschraken sich.* 

DIVERSE PASSANT:INNEN

Hey, aufpassen, ich mach hier ein Live.

Ist das der heilige Geist?

Ich glaube Gott ist tot.

¡Ayuda, el diablo!

Drecksviehsch!

Weiter davorn!

*Mit viel Staub verschwand die Gestalt im U-Bahn-Schacht!*

4.Kapitel  
DIE REISE

## Abstract

Auf der Suche nach der Wahrheit taumelte der Katzenpabst durch eine ihm unbekannte Stadt, in der sich Verbündete und Feinde vermischten und nichts so war, wie es schien. {PLF} versuchte, ihr zu entkommen.

## Script

*INT. U-Bahn*

Eingangssequenz. Es war tiefschwarze Nacht. Wir hörten ein langsames, schweres Atmen. {PLF} war benommen. Im Hintergrund drangen durch die morgendliche U-Bahn-Kulisse gefilterte Fetzen von Ansagen und Gesprächen vorbeilaufender Passant:innen, und eine nervtötende, an eine klassische Komposition eines alten, schon lange toten weißen Mannes erinnernde Melodie bohrte sich in die Nebenhirnrinden aller, die hier sein mussten um diese gottverdammte Uhrzeit.

PASSANT:IN 1 *zeigte deutlich mit dem Finger auf {PLF}*:

Na, servus. Ist es wirklich?

PASSANT:IN 2 *hinter vorgehaltener Hand*:

Ich glaube schon. Sieht traurig aus. Irgendwie ab der Lack.

PASSANT:IN 1

Die Haare auch, so ließen's sie aber nett rein.

PASSANT:IN 2

Fix.

PASSANT:IN 3 *machte ein Lockgeräusch und warf ein Stück Wurst auf den Boden vor {PLF}*:

Da!

{PLF} war verwirrt und ängstlich und begann, mit einer Rosenkranz-App zu beten, in der Hoffnung, dass das Ritual ihr Frieden bringen könnte. Die Wiederholung sollte Halt geben. Es schien jedoch wenig dazu beizutragen, die Konzentration zu bündeln, und half kaum, Ruhe in den Kopf zu bringen. Hätte {PLF} doch nur ihren analogen Fidget Cube dabei gehabt.

Das Licht und Donnern der einfahrenden U-Bahn zwang die Augenlider von {PLF}, sich zu öffnen. Die allgegenwärtigen Werbeanzeigen und Screens buhlten um {PLF}s Aufmerksamkeit.

PABST-ÄHNLICHE FIGUR

Was geschieht mit mir? Woher kommen all die falschen Götter?

Die Türen der U-Bahn öffneten sich, und {PLF} huschte hinein. Die Fahrt begann. Langsam bewegten wir uns aus [[Megaworld]] heraus, die Plakate wurden größer, die Götter mächtiger. Sanfte Piano-Akkorde des Chorus von [[Not My City]] erklangen. {PLF} starrte aus dem Fenster und entdeckte drei [[Krähenwesen]], die dem Gefährt folgten und versuchten, {PLF} eine Nachricht zu überbringen. {PLF} wimmelte sie ab und versuchte, in die Ferne zu blicken. Wir hatten die Stadt langsam hinter uns gebracht, und die Berge tauchten auf. Schnee bedeckte die Landschaft.

5.Kapitel  
DER BERGPFAD

## Abstract

Im hohen Gebirge geriet {PLF} in einen Schneesturm und wurde von Visionen und einer gefährlichen Bestie überfallen.

## Script

*EXT. Bergdorf/Pfad/Wegkreuzung*

ANNOATION füge noch Details hinzu. Schuhen, zu wenig Kleidung. Rote Finger, eisiger Wind der durch die Schlitze in der Robe weh. Blaue  Lippen.
Husten ,Hände unter die Achsel, das kribbeln des Blutes beim zurück strömen. Gefrorene rotze an der Nase. 

{PLF} stieg aus und befand sich auf einem Weg, der in die Berge führte. Es war bitterkalt. {PLF} war sich sicher: Eine Pilgerfahrt. Ein Sinnan. Ein suchender Akt größter Anstrengung – das würde Antworten bringen. Erfrieren? Nein, der Glaube. Der Wille. Die Aufgabe hielt warm. Damit schaffe ich es, dachte sich {PLF}. Vor einigen Jahren, in der Ausbildung, war {PLF} bereits einmal im Kloster auf dem Berg gewesen. Der Weg war beschwerlich, im pechschwarzem Unterholz, im Flimmern der kalten Luft, links und rechts und oben und unten lauerten täuschende Visionen, die versuchten, die Suchenden zu verwirren. Es waren nicht die Götter, es waren Geister, die Seelen der Gewässer, der Bäume, der Steine, der Lüfte. Die katholische Bildung war wie ein Studium der Philosophie, der Mathematik. Praktisches Wissen vermittelte {PLF} niemand. So war ihr die Natur immer das Monster das sie mied. Menschen waren ihr schon anstrengend genug.

Nach einer Weile tauchte hinter einer Kurve eine riesige reflektierende Kugel inmitten des Waldes auf. Hoch ragte sie über allem. Eine Vision? Ein Zeichen? Vielleicht die erste Antwort? Es war so kalt, es konnte eine Luftspiegelung sein. Was soll's! {PLF} packte allen Mut zusammen, die Hände bereits blau, und schleppte sich durch die Schneemassen dem mystischen Meilenstein entgegen. Um warm zu bleiben, feuerte sich {PLF} an und begann eine Choreografie. {PLF} schlang die Arme um den Körper und stampfte mit den Füßen auf den gefrorenen Boden. {STAMPF STAMPF} Laute Trommelschläge schallten durch das Tal. Gelegentlich hielt {PLF} inne und rieb sich die Hände. Sie atmeten tief ein, während sie im Rhythmus durch den Schnee wateten, ihre Bewegungen bestimmt und energisch, die Kälte mit jedem Schritt zurückdrängend. Der Puls stieg, die Kälte wich aus den Gliedern, und leise Affirmationen murmelten sie vor sich hin, um den Kampfgeist zu stärken.

Es war ein Kampf gegen die Urgewalten. Das befreite! Die Gefahr der Lawinen ließ das Adrenalin in die Adern schießen, und nahezu mühelos eilte {PLF} der Fata Morgana entgegen. Im Geäst des Waldes tauchte im Augenwinkel von {PLF} ein bedrohliches Wesen auf. {PLF} erhöhte das Tempo, doch es half nichts. Nach einem schnellen Blick war es immer noch dicht auf den Fersen. {PLF} drehte sich um und erblickte ein riesiges weißes Tier, aus dessen Maul warmer Atem strömte. Es war ein [[Weißer Tiger]]. {PLF} und der Tiger waren bereits gleichauf nebeneinander, beide eilten synchron den Berg hinauf. Auf einer Lichtung schaffte es der Tiger, sich {PLF} in den Weg zu stellen. {PLF} erkannte die Aussichtslosigkeit der Flucht und blieb stehen. Es war High Noon, und die Duellant:innen starrten sich an. Beide schrien sich an in wilder Folge, als wären sie ein Dub-Soundsystem-Soundoff. Auf den umliegenden Bäumen wurde der Schnee von den Ästen gerüttelt, und vereinzelt stiegen kleine Vögel und Geister in den Himmel. Ein Reh suchte das Weite, eine Gruppe Hasen grub sich ein. Es kehrte wieder Ruhe ein, die Luft war zum Schneiden.

{PLF} ging in sich, sammelte alle Energien, formte mit den Händen einen Eisenergieball und schleuderte diesen mit einem lauten Kamehameha auf das edle Tier. Der Tiger hatte sich bereits in Bewegung gesetzt und eilte auf {PLF}s Position zu. Blitzartig wandte sich {PLF} und rannte auf einen großen Felsen zu. Der Tiger wurde vom Blitz getroffen, konnte die Verfolgung jedoch aufnehmen und stürzte {PLF} hinterher. {PLF} kam dem Felsen näher, warf sich blitzartig dahinter auf den Boden. Der Tiger, noch betäubt vom Energieball, verschätzte den Bremsweg, der nötig gewesen wäre. Zusammengekauert beobachtete {PLF}, wie das wuchtige Tier über den Felsen in den Abgrund fiel. Ein lauter Schrei erfüllte das Tal. {PLF} war fürs Erste sicher. Ein kurzes Stoßgebet, ein prüfender Blick.

Es war überstanden, doch ein weißer Schneesturm zog auf. Sich beinahe verirrend, verzweifelt am Boden kriechend, bemerkte {PLF} mit letzter Kraft nach einer Weile ein Stück einer Mauer und einen Strauch mit kleinen roten Beeren. Es musste das Kloster sein. {PLF} spurtete los und suchte den Eingang, rutschte noch einmal tolpatschig auf den Treppen aus und fand schließlich die Pforte. {PLF} trat ein.

BILDUNGSLÜCKEN

## Abstract

{PLF} hofft, in der Bibliothek des Klosters Antworten über die Herkunft des Katzentieres zu finden, das ihre Reise begleitet. Doch diese Suche führt tiefer in ein Netz aus Kontrolle, Manipulation und die dunklen Machenschaften einer angeblichen Suche nach Fortschritt.
## Script

INT. Monastry Library

Mit riesigen weit aufgerissen Augen. Entzückt. Voll Freude wie ein Kind betratt {PLF} diese ihr vertrauten Räume. 

{PLF} *zitiert Thomas Aquinas*:

Beware the man with the one book! {PAH} Fear the man who owns all the books!

Augenblicklich fühlt {PLF} zurück versetzt als sie noch {YOUNGPLF} war. 
Der Geruch von verstaubten Papier, modrigen Leder, das Schimmernde Licht von Kerzen. Die Lesepulte an den Säulen die in den Himmel ragten. {PLF} streicht über ein staubiges Pult. Genau erinnert sich {PLF} wie sie das erste mal die Bücher die ihr Weltbild prägen sollten zwischen all dem Kirchenlatein fand.

BÜCHER

{PLF} spürte es – eine pulsierende Energie schein die polierten Böden flickern. Die alten Bücherregalen vibrierten in kosmischen Frequenzen. 432 Hertz. Es war ein vertrautes Gefühl, eines, das so lange gefehlt hatte. Dies war keine gewöhnliche Bibliothek. Dies war die Bibliothek in der {YPLF} nach den Werkzeugen suchte, die Sprache der Welt zu verstehen, sich der Menschen mit ihr zu bedienen. Mehr noch als verstehen, sie zu lenken und zu schaffen. {YPLF} brannte sie zu steuern. 

Sie fühlte sich schon damals ausgewählt und war sich nirgends wo so sicher zu einer Elite gehören zu werden, wie die Mönchen in den alten Klostern, die Latein beherrschten. Das besondere an diesen Bibliotheken war eben dass hier all das Wissen auch der Feinde der Kirche, verborgen wurden. Es war das Werkzeug, für die die die Matrix verstanden und sie neu zusammen setzen konnten. Durch Fleiß, das Mantra wiederholend, ja auswendig lernen und kopieren und beim kopieren zu verfeinern, zu aktualisieren. {YPLF} wusste, die Wahrheit entsteht in diesem Prozess. 

{PLF} fängt sich und snapt aus der Erinnerung zurück. Gut, Katze! Was ist dein Geheimnis. Die Bibel im alten und neuen gaben keine Antworten. Es gab wohl keine Mäuse, die Sinnflut muss sie dahin gerafft haben. Die Viecher waren arbeitslos. {PLF} grub durch die klassischen Text Griechenlands. Hier Artemis, naja, eher ein Luchs. Hekates Begleiter? Schwarze Katzen. Zaubererei? Hexerei? {SHRUG}

{PLF} schlug ein weiteres Buch auf und sah das Bild eines Bastet Sistrums. Party Katze? Die Ägypter wussten wie gefeiert wird, dachte sich {PLF} aber das dürre Viech soll eine Fruchtbarkeitsgottheit sein? Furchbarkeitsgottheit eher. Und das Geräusch mag ich mir gar nicht vorstellen. {PLF} frustrierte von Buch zu Buch. Alles nur semantik. Bilder, Vergleiche, Aufgeladener Schrott, nichts was sie auch schon längst benutzt hätte für die Rhetorik der Kunde des heiligen Willens des einen. 

{PLF} *verliert die Geduld*: 

Nichts! So komm ich nicht weiter. So schön es auch ist in Nostalgie zu schwelgen, jetzt muss ich ernst machen. 

ERZÄHLER:IN

Reiss dich zusammen, ermunterte sich {PLF}, schlug das Buch zu. 
Verzweifelung machte sich erneut spürbar. Ich werde in diesem Labyrinth nichts mehr finden. Das hier klingt alles überhaupt nicht Zeitgemäß, dachte {PLF} und konnte das Gefühl nicht los werden, daß die von ihr so geliebt Religion nicht mehr die Macht besaß, die sie früher auf ihn auszustrahlen vermochte. 

Die Sprache war alt. Sie war alt. Sie fühlte sich alt. Was {PLF} jedoch noch nicht bewusst war an diesem Snapshot, einem Standpunkt in der non-linearität der Zeit, daß oft genau dieser Standpunkt nur alt sein kann, weil eine Person eben da gerade drauf stand und das ist ja logisch gesehen, alt also vergangen ab dem Moment wo die Bewegung einfriert. Ein Änderung des Standpunkts würde ganz neue Türen öffnen. Doch wie lang müßen wir hier {PLF} noch zusehen bis sie begreift, das es Zeit ist. {WOOSH} 

CHOR *hauchte sanft:

They had to do this
They wanted to kill him
They started to cry
They turned to them

Im Schatten des Gewölbes flimmerte das Licht flüchtig über ihre glänzenden Augen, die alles sahen, die alles erkannten. Kein Raum war verborgen vor ihr, auch dieser nicht.

Da, am Ende des langen, kalten Ganges, ein Regal. Verstaubt. Schief. Die Bücher darin zu bedeutungslos, um hier wirklich zu sein. Eine Täuschung. Ein Trick. {PLF} wusste, dass sich dahinter mehr verbarg – etwas, das jenseits des Staubs und der Stille atmete. Eine andere Welt, verborgen hinter Papier.

Mit einem Blick, wissend und kalt, näherte sie sich. Keine Magie. Keine Geheimnisse. Nur Code. Nur ein Spiel, das darauf wartete, entschlüsselt zu werden.

*INTERAKTIVE*
Eine leise Berührung an einem unscheinbaren Sensor in der Wand. Ihre digitale Pranke legte sich darauf, und sie sprach die Worte – Worte, die den Code knacken sollten:

"Data is.  
Business is.  
Money is.  
God."

Das Zischen der Regale klang wie ein ferner Hauch. Sie fuhren zur Seite, und die wahre Kammer lag vor {PLF}. Eine Serverfarm, verborgen unter der Klosterbibliothek. Bildschirme flackerten sanft, blassblaues Licht über die stillen Maschinen, als würde sie selbst atmen, wach und allwissend.

Dies war kein Zufall. Kein Rätsel des Schicksals. Sondern ein digitales Artefakt, platziert, um gefunden zu werden.

_Szene: Kloster-Serverfarm-Terminals_

Dies war es – das Herz der Klosterbibliothek. Ein hochmodernes Kontrollzentrum, getarnt als Ort des Wissens.

Für einen Moment verharrte {PLF}. In den Augen reflektierte das Leuchten der Terminals. Automatisiert schalteten laut Relais beisendes Neonlicht in treibender Frequenz an.

Die Suche nach Antworten hatte hierher geführt, doch es ging schon längst nicht mehr um das bloße Entdecken einfacher Wahrheiten. Die nostalgische Hoffnung, die Vergangenheit zu ergründen, war verflogen. Jetzt ging es darum, die Kontrolle über die Gegenwart – und die Zukunft – zu erlangen. Die Worte der Macht hallten in ihrem Kopf wider: "DATA IS POWER"

Als {PLF} sich näher an das Terminal lehnte, erfüllte eine seltsame Ladung die Luft, die mit unausgesprochener Energie schwirrte. Seine Finger tanzten über die Tastatur, angetrieben von Instinkt und Dringlichkeit. Der Bildschirm leuchtete auf und offenbarte Ablagen mit verschlüsselten Dateien, die auf etwas hinwiesen, das weit über einfache Daten hinausging. Eine Datei erregte seine Aufmerksamkeit: „CATS.MANIFEST“.

Sein Herz raste: C.A.T.S. Cognitive Augmentation and Transcendence System. In dem Dokument wurde die Notwendigkeit beschrieben, eine neue Super Religion zu schaffen. 

Das Manifest zielte darauf ab, Glauben, Wissenschaft und himmlische Wesen zu einer neuen Religion zu verschmelzen - einer Religion, die es endlich schaffen würde die Grenzen der Erde zu überschreiten, bereit um den Kosmos zu erobern. 

Phase 1: Verschmelzung des Bewusstseins von Spieler:innen und ihren Avataren. 

Weiter führte der Text an:

Die Menschen haben einen traurigen Entwicklungsstand erreicht, an dem wir es für Möglich erachten und bitten das Kommitee mit größter Notwendigkeit, die von den Menschen entwickleten Technologien mit den unsrigen zu verbinden und empfehlen die Schaffung einer neuen Religion. Die Studie hat ergeben, daß die Vorraussetzungen von einigen Konzernen bereits gesetzt wurden und mit wenigen gut platzierten Spielen und Content, eine Massenhysterie zum gewünschten Effekt binnen weniger Jahre führen sollte. Als Gründe hat die Kommission, genannt, dass für die Verbindung von Avataren mit neuen Bewusstsein, die Vorraussetzung einer Trans notwendig wäre, die angesichts des erstaunlichen Anwachsen von Dauerkonsumierung und Endloser Überbeanspruchung neuraler Prozess durch diverse Formen digitaler und nicht digitaler Rituale bestehen...

Gerade als die Tragweite dieses Experiments deutlich wurde, begann das Terminal wild zu flackern. Codezeilen scrollten dramatisch über den Bildschirm. Eine Warnung erscheint „Vorsicht: Abstoßung des Bewusstseins“. 

Ein kalter Schauer überkam {PLF}. {KLACK} Schlagartig war der Raum dunkel. Notlichter sprangen an. Der Schweiss auf {PLF}s Stirn reflektiert sauer-grün.

Unsichtbare Zeichen standen in der Luft. Fragmente eines Rituals. Ein weiterer Kampf stand bevor.

{KLICKER} 
{KLICKER KLICKER} Das Geklicker und Geklackert kam näher und wurde immer lauter und kräftiger. Der Vokal formt sich vom i uebers a zum o. Jetzt endlich erkannte {PLF} es. 
{KLACKER KLACKER} 
Die [[Krähenwesen]], die sie während der Reise schon mehrfach aufsuchten, waren zurück.
{PLF} spürte, wie das Adrenalin durch seine Adern pumpte, während sein Herz wie ein riesiger Schlägel gegen seinen Brustkorb trommelt. Ihre dürren Leiber, ihre langen Schnäbel werfen lange Schatten in die Korridore die an Samurai Schwerter erinnern. Ihre pechschwarzen Augen reflektieren kleine scharfe grüne Punkte. {FLATTER FLATTER} {SWOSH} Mit einem gewaltigen Satz werden die Punkte zu Linien, einer Laserprojektion gleichend, und bewegend in Bruchteil einer Sekunde auf {PLF} zu. 
Schnell zog sie ihren Arm zurück, um einem Angriff zu entkommen. Der dabei entstandene Luftsog fröstelt ihre erhitzte Haut.  
  
Die Krähenwesen lachten spöttisch, ihre Stimmen krächzten rau und hallten durch die Hallen. 
Ein fauliger Geruch von {PLF}s Angstschweiß mischte sich in die klinische Mischung aus warmer Elektronik, Plastik und kalter, klimatisierter Luft – ein einzigartiger Duft, der könnten Filme riechen bei DEFCON4 ins Kino eingeströmt werden müßte. 

*Video Sequence: Cat Pope steht vor der Kamera im Podcast Setup*

Okay, Leute, stellt euch mal die Welt so vor – aber als *Geruch*. Ja, richtig gehört, heute reden wir über die *Vibes*, aber nicht visuell, sondern *olfaktorisch*! 🤯

Also, lasst uns reinjumpen: 

🕊 Katholizismus:
Dieser Vibe? Pure Nostalgie. Stellt euch vor, ihr seid in 'nem alten Kirchengebäude: es riecht nach Holz, ein bisschen dusty Stein vibes, und – boom – *Weihrauch*. Es ist so ein "Mystery-Vibe", als ob da tausend Geheimnisse und "heilige" Momente im Raum schweben würden. ✨

🙌 Protestantismus:
Hier geht’s bisschen rougher zu. Keine fancy Räucherstäbchen oder sowas, sondern einfach OG *altes Gemäuer* und – I kid you not – bisschen nach, naja, *Menschsein*. Es ist wie so ein ehrlicher, rauer Duft, als ob da einfach der Fokus auf den Basics liegt, versteht ihr? 🪨💧

 🤑 Neoliberalismus:
Wenn dieser Vibe ein Raum wär, dann halt so ein *klimatisiertes Büro* mit ner menge Plastik, Monitore überall und ständig surrende Server. Der Geruch ist irgendwie *kalt*, voll steril und leicht elektrisch. Es riecht nach Konsum, aber ohne Tiefe, wie so ein neuer Laptop oder die Luft im Apple Store. 🖥️💸

🧘 Buddhismus Yoga Selbstoptimierer:
Hier kommt der pure Zen-Modus. Dieser Vibe ist voller *Sandelholz* und *Räucherstäbchen* und irgendwie fühlst du dich instant in so nem Peace-Modus. Stell dir vor, du atmest die Natur ein, richtig frische Luft – fast schon so klar, als ob dein Kopf auf "Do Not Disturb" steht. 🍃🌸

 📲 TikTok-Streamer:
Yeah, der Geruch ist – let’s be real – eine wilde Mischung! Plastik und Elektronik durch die ganzen Lichter, Make-up und so’n bisschen süßes Parfüm gemixt mit Fast-Food vibes. Es ist wie das Leben zwischen Likes und Chips, alles leicht chaotisch, aber auch kinda *awesome*. ✌️🍟✨

 ☪️ Islam:
Jetzt wird’s deep, Freunde. Der Vibe hier ist *Moschus* und *Oud* – so ein warmer, erdiger Duft, der dich irgendwie grounding bringt. Da ist so eine subtile Note von *Rosenwasser* und diese Frische, die einfach clean und echt rüberkommt. Pure Ehrfurcht, Leute. 🌹🙏

Okay, das war’s erstmal – was denkt ihr, nach was riecht euer *Vibe*? 👃💭 Schreibt's mir in die Kommentare!

*Zurück in den Kampf im Serverraum*

{PLF} wich in die Ecke aus. Ein weiter Angriff steht bevor.  
  
Ihre Hände zitterten, als sie sich an das Kamehameha erinnerte, die einzige Möglichkeit zur Rettung, die ihr wohl blieb. Aufgeben? Niemals! dachte sie verzweifelt, als sie sich mit aller Kraft zusammenriss und ihre Energie kanalisierte. Der Kälte des Raumes wich ein warmer Schimmer, als sie ihre Hände hob und mit einem lauten Schrei den Angriff entfesselte. Die Energie des Kamehameha raste durch die Luft und erfüllte den Raum mit einer flirrenden Spannung. Transistoren und LEDs fingen plötzlich an, in intensiven Farben zu glühen, als ob sie die übernatürliche Kraft nicht nur leiteten, sondern sie in einem letzten, elektrisierenden Tanz feierten. Ihre Lichter pulsierten, blitzten auf, und die Gerätschaften schienen für einen Moment zu leben. Dann, in einem unermesslich grellen Licht, erreichte die Energie ihren Höhepunkt. Für einen Augenblick schien die Zeit stillzustehen, bevor alles in sich zusammenbrach – das Licht erlosch, die Maschinen verstummten, und die Farm versank in tiefer, unheimlicher Stille.
  
Die Krähenwesen schrien laut auf, flatterten panisch umher und verschwanden im Dunkel. Dieser Kampf war gewonnen, dachte {PLF}, während sie sich mühsam durch den finsteren Serverraum schleppte. Die flackernden, stillgelegten Bildschirme und Kabelsalate um sie herum wirkten wie ein kaltes, technisches Grab. Der metallische Geruch von Überhitzung lag schwer in der Luft. Doch sie wusste, dass es noch nicht vorbei war.

Mit letzter Kraft entdeckte sie eine Tür am Ende des Raumes, die wie der Eingang zu einer Gruft wirkte. Keuchend stemmte sie sich dagegen, bis diese knirschend nachgab und {PLF} ins Freie stolperte. Vor ihr breitete sich der Friedhof aus, der Geruch von feuchter Erde und verwesenden Blättern pochte in der Luft. Ein bitterer, stiller Sieg – doch sie wusste, kein Triumph kommt ohne Preis. Doch was war der Preis? Was steckte hinter den geheimen Repositories? Ein neues Testament? Projekt Elysium?

7.Kapitel
DER FRIEDHOF

## Abstract

{PLF} erkundete den Friedhof, in dem die Realität zunehmend instabil wurde. Auf der Suche nach Antworten wurde er von unheimlichen Verzerrungen heimgesucht, die ihn in eine Welt ohne Individualität führen, wo Menschen nur durch Rollen und Titel definiert sind. Die surreale Atmosphäre und das Gefühl, in einem fehlerhaften System gefangen zu sein, treiben {PLF} an den Rand des Wahnsinns.
## Script

*Friedhofsgruft*

{PLF} trat aus der Gruft hinaus, die Dunkelheit noch in seinen Gedanken nachhallend, und stand nun inmitten der gespenstischen Stille des Friedhofs. Der Kampf mit den Krähenwesen hatte ihn schwer gezeichnet, nicht nur äußerlich. Ihr boshaftes Lachen, als sie sich zurückzogen, hallte noch immer in seinen Ohren. Sie wussten etwas, das ihm verborgen blieb. Der Sieg fühlte sich hohl an, als hätte er nur einen kleinen Teil eines viel größeren, ungreifbaren Ganzen errungen.

Der Himmel war klar, doch die Realität um ihn herum flackerte wie ein gestörter Bildschirm. Es waren kleine, fast unmerkliche Verzerrungen, die ihm das Gefühl gaben, in einer Welt gefangen zu sein, die nicht ganz real war. Ein Glitch, ein Fehler im Gewebe der Wirklichkeit, der ihm immer wieder das Gefühl gab, nicht mehr zu wissen, was wahr war und was nicht.

Das Sonnenlicht, das seine Haut wärmte, beruhigte seine Nerven für einen kurzen Moment. Doch die Störungen blieben, kleine Sprünge in seiner Wahrnehmung, als ob Teile der Umgebung plötzlich verschwanden und an anderer Stelle wieder auftauchten. Der Friedhof selbst wirkte wie eine digitale Illusion, ein Ort, der in der nächsten Sekunde zusammenbrechen könnte.

{PLF} begann seine Erkundung, aber die Glitches störten immer wieder seine Suche. Die Realität schien sich willkürlich zu verschieben. Ein Grabstein, den er gerade noch gesehen hatte, war im nächsten Moment verschwunden, und die Umrisse von Bäumen flackerten, als ob sie in verschiedene Dimensionen versetzt würden. Zwischen den flimmernden Szenen tauchte immer wieder die Spynx-Katze auf, ein seltsames Wesen, das wie eine lebende Anomalie wirkte. Sie schien mit den Glitches zu verschmelzen, blitzte an verschiedenen Stellen des Friedhofs auf, verschwand und erschien erneut, als würde sie durch die Fehler im System hindurchgleiten.

Verwirrt und zunehmend verunsichert versuchte {PLF}, der Katze zu folgen. Sie führte ihn immer tiefer in den Friedhof, aber jeder Versuch, näher an sie heranzukommen, wurde durch weitere Glitches unterbrochen. Der Boden unter seinen Füßen schien zu ruckeln, als würde er plötzlich an einen anderen Ort transportiert werden, nur um im nächsten Moment wieder zurückzuspringen. Nichts hier folgte den Regeln der normalen Welt.

Dann, inmitten dieser Störsignale, machte {PLF} eine Entdeckung, die ihn mit einer Welle aus Furcht erfüllte. Als er versuchte, die Inschriften der Grabsteine zu lesen, spürte er, wie die Störungen sich um ihn verdichteten. Die Namen, die er zu entziffern versuchte, verschwammen vor seinen Augen, und plötzlich erkannte er, dass da keine Namen standen – nur Funktionen, Rollen in einer grotesken Hierarchie. „Wächter:in“, „Krieger:in“, „Berater:in“, "Influencer", "AI Ethiker:in". Kein einziger Name, keine Identität. Nur Positionen, wie in einem undurchdringlichen System.

Seine Angst wuchs, als er hastig weiterlief, in der Hoffnung, Gräber zu finden, die ihm mehr verraten würden. Die Glitches um ihn herum wurden intensiver, als ob die Realität selbst auf diesen Moment reagierte. Schließlich stieß er auf die Gräber der Kirchenpatriarchen. Doch die Glitches um ihn herum intensivierten sich, und die Realität ruckelte noch mehr. Auch dort standen keine Namen – nur ein einziges Wort, immer und immer wieder, so wie sie es schon befürchtet hatte: „Pope“ – immer und immer wieder. Keine Unterscheidung, keine Geschichte. Nur Titel, als ob diese Menschen niemals existiert hätten, als Individuen ausgelöscht. Selbst ihre Titel schienen sich inmitten der Glitches zu verändern. „CEO“, "Guru", „Moderator:in“, „Thought Leader:in“, „Startup-Gründer:in“. Titel, die nicht nur alt, sondern auch modern und aus der digitalen Welt stammten, als hätte die Hierarchie des Systems sich über die Jahrhunderte hinweg einfach nur angepasst. Der Friedhof war keine Ruhestätte – er war ein lebendiges Archiv, eine gespenstige Vision einer ihm verständlichen Welt, in der Individualität längst durch Funktionen und Rollen ersetzt worden waren. 
 
{PLF}’s Atem ging schneller. Er eilte zu einem Brunnen um Wasser zu trinken, doch alles um ihn herum begann immer heftiger zu ruckeln, und die Glitches wurden zu regelrechten Rissen in seiner Wahrnehmung. Ein Wassertropfen wie {PLF} bereits auf dem Weg in die Berge gesehen hatte erhob sich aus dem Becken. Während die Wasserkugel intakt blieb, schien sich die Struktur des Friedhofs jedoch zu verschieben, als ob die gesamte Szenerie instabil wurde. Der Boden unter ihm flackerte, und er hörte ein Geräusch – ein unheimliches, verzerrtes Rascheln, das klang wie ein beschädigter Ton in einem gestörten Video. 

{PLF} wusste, dass er hier etwas Schreckliches angestossen hatte. Doch bevor er einen klaren Gedanken fassen konnte, verzog sich die Welt erneut, und alles um ihn herum war in Bewegung – als ob die Zeit selbst sich gegen ihn stellte. 
Um ihn herum schien sich die Welt in einem kontinuierlichen Strom aus Unwirklichkeit aufzulösen. Bäume und Grabsteine verschwanden, tauchten wieder auf und verschoben sich in verzerrte Formen. Alles begann sich zu verdrehen, als ob das Gewebe der Realität selbst zerriss.

{MIAAAAAAAAUUUUU} Plötzlich erklang ein langgezogenes Miauen – ein vertrauter Klang inmitten des Wahnsinns. {PLF} erstarrte, sein Kopf ruckte in die Richtung des Geräuschs. Dort, am Rande seines Sichtfeldes, stand die Sphynx-Katze, ihre goldenen Augen blitzten im flackernden Licht. Ein Aura umgab sie. Ihre schlanke Silhouette schien sich nicht von den umgebenden Verzerrungen beeinflussen zu lassen. Sie wirkte fest und real, während alles andere flüchtig und brüchig war. Meditierte sie? Schwebte Sie?

{MIAAAUUU} Ein weiteres, tieferes Miauen kam von der Katze, dieses Mal klang es wie eine Mischung aus Dringlichkeit und Einladung. Die Erscheinung kam aus Richtung eines verwitterten Tors am Rand des Friedhofs – ein Tor, das {PLF} zuvor kaum beachtet hatte, wieso auch, dachte er doch noch antworten zu finde. Es führte in den Klostergarten.

Obwohl er zögerte, spürte {PLF}, dass dies die einzige stabile Spur in der flimmernden Welt war, der er folgen konnte. Die Glitches um ihn herum verstärkten sich weiter, als ob sie versuchten, ihn zu verschlingen. Doch das Miauen der Katze schnitt durch die verzerrten Geräusche, und der Garten jenseits des Tors wirkte seltsam unberührt. Dort schien die Realität intakt zu bleiben.

Mit einem letzten Blick auf den zerfallenden Friedhof setzte {PLF} sich in Bewegung. {SCHNURR} Das Schnurren der Katze manifestiert sich. Es bildet sich eine Brücke aus Buchstaben hinein in den Klostergarten. {PLF} tritt durch ein knarrendes Tor hinein.

GARTEN EDEN

Schon wieder glaubte {PLF} endlich den Dämonen und Visionen entkommen zu sein. Doch erwartet im vermeintlichen Garten Eden eine realitätsverändernde Erkenntnis auf sie.
## Script

EXT. GARDEN EDEN 

sunset

PABST-ÄHNLICHE FIGUR

Wie konnte es sein, dass alles gerade noch so desolat, 
so fatalistisch,
so überweltigend (sic) war, 
Ich schien zu fallen.
Und nun steck ich fest.
Ich auf sanftem Festen Boden?
Wie mit sanften Pfoten.
Oben ist wieder unten?
Nunja, die Hände im Dreck haben mich für einen Moment zum, wie nannten sie es in Russland nochmal? Quadrobiing, also zu einem Quadrant gemacht.

grübelt {PLF}.

Neuverordnen! 
Zeit für ein Bodyscan!
5-4-3-3-2! Action!

kommandierte sie eine unterbewußte Stimme.

{Uff} Stimmt, stöhnt {PLF} ein wenig überrascht wo das nun her kam. Dies war eines von der Therapeutin empfohlen Bewältigungsmechanismen im Falle einer Sinnflut. Nicht austrocknen, sondern sich selbst im Chaos fühlen lernen. 

{Pah} Heut morgen schien alles noch so In Ord Nung, dachte sich {PLF}. Dann die ganze Tortur, wilde Wesen, Angriffe, Bücher, die ich noch nie gesehen habe? Erklär mir bitte mal wer wieso hier kein Schnee mehr liegt?, raste es durch das Gehirn von {PLF}. 

Augen auf! *schrie nun die Stimme von allen Seiten vom Chor verstärkt.*

{PLF} begann mit der Übung. 

5 Dinge die ich sehe!

*Während {PLF} durch die von der Abendsonne durchzogene Beetreihen streifte fing sie an mechanisch aufzuzählen. Tomatenstauden, Thymian, Baby Chili Paprika, krokodilsartigen OBI Gießkannen und aufgebockte Wasserspeicher aus - nunja, beinahe Yves Klein-blauem - Plastik.*

Check. triumphiert {PLF} Jetzt, 4 Dinge hören.

{PLF} streift langsam umher und spitz die Ohren. 

Ruhe. Endlich würde es Ruhe. Okay, dass kann gezählt werden, lobte sich {PLF} Zweitens, ein Windspiel aus leichten holen Holzstäben {BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK} in einiger Entfernung. Drittens, ... {PLF} konzentrierte sich, schloß die Augen. Atmetete tief ein. {BRIZZZZZZZZZZ} Das satte Brummen einer Hochspannungsleitung! {BSSSSS} Da sauste eine Fliege an {PLF}s Ohr schnell vor rüber. Das Summen würde langsam tiefer. Was ein Dopplereffekt und tolles Stereo, dachte sich {PLF}. Viertens. Check! 

Verwundert schaute eine Meise mit Wurm von ihrem Ast dem Treiben lautlos zu.{???}

3 Dinge spüren. {PLF} streckte beide Arme weit aus, die Augen noch geschloßen. Obwohl die Sonne bereits mit einem Bein im Grab stand für heute bemerkte {PLF} ihre radioaktiven Strahlen genau. Es brannte ein wenig, doch nicht unbedingt unangenehm. Erstens, check. Durch ihre Finger glitten hochgewachsene Gräser und kitzelten sie behutsam an Unterarm und Ellenbogen. Check. {PLF} zog die Arme zurück zum Körper und fühlte den Stoff der edlen Garbadine. Mit den Fingerkuppen konnte sie jeden Faden und deren Richtung genaustens ertasten. Welch Ordnung! Welch Perfektion! dachte sich {PLF} CHECK, das waren die drei. 

{SCHNUFF SCHNUFF} Riechen genau. Grün. Grasig, Erfrischen. Okay. Ein Gemüse, dass nach einer Farbe riecht? Ha, Brechbohne triumphierte {PLF}. Zweitens, hier riecht es nach Humus. Check. Saftige kompostierte Erde. Nun fehlte {PLF} nur noch der letzte Sinn. Das Schmecken. Es war bitter. Glutamat artig, ein wenig wie altes Fleisch jedoch. {PAH} 

{PLF} spuckt und reißt die Augen auf. Vor ihr eine Pfütze. In der Reflektion erkannte {PLF} die Katzer wieder. Du bist es? Aber wie kann das sein? ... {PLF} starrte Regungslos in die Pfütze und langsam beginnt der geerdete Geist zu verstehen. Jetzt, machte alle Sinn. {PLF} fehlte die Kraft sich weiter zu währen. Es sollte ja doch nichts mehr helfen. Und mit einem Säufzen stöhnt sie,

Ich bin die Katze!

[[Crack pope in the morning]] is the first song. 

Low voice, broken down. 

Cat wakes up in a world of low life. Lässt sich total gehen. Der Glaube an Gott ist verschwunden, der Glaube an das eigene selbst ist nicht mehr existent. Cat pope hat sich ganzlich dem excess hingegeben. Gezeigt wird Eiinr Katze  dessen ganzes Weltbild zerschmettert wurde. 

die meiste Hälfte zeichnen wir hauptsächlich eine Welt des selbst mitleids, der Schuld zu Weisungen, Leute helfen wollen werden beschuldigt sie anzugreifen und zerstören zu wollen. Hier und da flackern noch allmachtsfantasien und Ausbrüche auf. Jedoch fehlt längst der Glanz, Rausschmisse aus Bars, selbst in einer kleinen Gemeinde von Ratten in der Kanalisation wird cat pope ausfällig fund beleidigt die anwesenden Ratten und gossen Katzen als abschaum die durch ihre Faulheit das Reich gottes erstens nie erreichen werden und zweitens maßgeblich dafür verantwortlich sind das die Erde zu Grunde geht und die Wirtschaft, und die Krankheiten.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Graphic Novel\Season Ideas\In der Klosterschreibwerkstatt.md

Bassierend auf der Kern idee, dass programmier:innen in der digitalen Gesellschaft, wie zuvor die Schreiber der Klösterschreibsäale die Bewahren der Ordnung sind. 

Den Schreib/Microcodierer ist es zu Kopf gestiegen. Sie  Kopieren der immergleichen Regeln und Texte ermöglicht die Stabilität einer konkreten Weltordnung. Wie viel einfluss sie tatsächlich darauf haben ist fraglich. denn nunja, dass wird cat pope in diesem buch rausfinden. Auf der Erkundung der welt ausserhalb der simulation lernt cat pope einen neuen lebensstil lieben. eine zockende katze. doch bis dahin sind es noch ein paar entwicklungsschritte.

Im Kontext von Cat Pope ist dies eine Erschütternde Erkenntnis. Ein System das noch mächtiger ist als die Katholische Kirche?
Nach der Entdeckung über die Wahrheit ihrer eigenen Existenz entscheidet sich Cat Pope mehr über das Bewusstseins Projekt und die Welt um sie herum zu erfahren. Wer beherrscht die Welt? Wer hat sie in Auftrag gegeben? 

Cat Pope betritt nun eine Welt in der Code herrscht, eine dystopische Begenung, wie im Alien Prequel in einer monotonen, jedoch kleinbürgerlichen Elite, in der Schweiz, in Deutschland, in China, in Silikon Valley und in Bali. Die Lebensweise der Programmer:innen bringt einen Lebenstil. Die Gilde. Um diese Herum gibt es Berater, Business Developer und Investment Manager. Es geht hier nicht um spekulationen, und schnelle profite. es geht um den betrieb von Emperien. Zu gross sind die Netzwerke, zu verwurzelt die Legacy Software. Wie die Katholische Kirche geht es allen die in diesem system arbeiten nicht um schnelle Innovation ausser ein paar Amerikanischen Wanna Bee Billionären, die mit viel Anstrengung nach Aufmerksamkeit betteln. Die Wahre Kraft liegt in dem Bewusstsein, unantastbar zu sein, weil die Wahrheit, der Gospel in ihrer Macht steht. 

In diesem Buch erfährt Cat Pope, das es Katzen sind die die eigentlichen Auftrag geber sind, und das was Cat Pope bisher als Realität betrachtet hatte eine Simulation ist. Katzen schlüpfen hier vom Comfort ihres Sofaplatzes in verschiedene Rollen, beispielsweise Pope, oder Cow Boy oder Guru oder Tradwife, meisst mit einer lässigen VR Brille. Eine Art Garfield Reality, nur muss John nicht selber Zahlen. Das von ihnen entwickelte spiel funktioniert wie eine in sich geschlossene Ökonomie und wirft rendite ab, und produziert auch noch waren, vorallem viele gute snacks. Da alle Katzen wissen, dass eine richtige Routine ihnen nicht liegt, haben sie bereits früh angefangen stark auf den einsatz von selbst optimierenden algorithmen zu setzen. Das Spiel ist eher ein disrupten, das ist der Zeitvertreib, und dann wenn die Aufmerksamkeit an einer tätigkeit schwindet, lass die die algo ihren job einfach weiter machen und wenden sich einem schläfchen oder anderen betätigungen zu. Die einbusen sind optimiert und schwindend klein. somit ist immer für genügend nahrung gesorgt und auch für lieferservice.

absicht muss noch klar definiert werden.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Graphic Novel\Season Ideas\Possible Deaths.md

### antworter Figuren 
[1] „Daher auch die _‚Uschebti‘_, kleine Figuren, Grabbeigaben, die in verschiedenen Exemplaren in Basel zu sehen sind, ‚Antworter‘, die, wenn der Tote vom Totenbett zur Arbeit im Jenseits aufgerufen wird, an seiner Stelle antworten: ‚Hier bin ich.‘“[[6]](https://de.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Uschebti#cite_note-6) danach muss die Figur zur Arbeit gehen 

Übernehmen die aufgeben des Toten im Jenseits 
Das Jenseits war im alten Ägypten ein fruchtbares Land was aber bestellt werden musste.

Verstorben nicht endgültig Tod so lange die Erinnerung bewahrt ist .

Die Unbekannte aus der seine totenmaske ist oft bei realisations Puppen verwendet weil sie so friedlich aussieht . Der freitod soll ihr friedliches Gesicht erzeugt haben 

Inszenierungsidee : ein Ritual des Gedenkens bei dem die Freunde einem beim trauern begleiten fehlt in meiner Realität. Bei Tod meiner geliebten Omas war ich jeweils abwesend , in Arbeit gefangen, oder im Rausch . Ich habe unterbewusst nach weltlichen Dingen gesucht um eine Ausrede zu haben dem Act nicht bei zu wohnen. Zu groß die Angst vor der Ungewissheit.

Sacrificium intellectus hieß das in Bezug auf die Religion, wo dieses Opfer Voraussetzung der Hingabe, des Glaubens war. Die Vorstellung „alternativer Fakten“ muss also ins Register des Religiösen eingereiht werden.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Graphic Novel\Season Ideas\School of Saints.md

A coming of age story about the formative years.

Cat pope and other spiritual figures in their adolescent years visit a high school that teaches them about the basics of spirituality and prepare them for saving the population of the world.

Taking place in a high school its a story about allies, friendships, love and hate, exploring sexuality, and social divide. 

Students and teachers are segregated in rich and poor faiths in which a main character has to over come many a more obstacles and temptations on their path to graduation.

The school teaches foremost how to become a saint, but not calling oneself one. The characters are driven by the urge to change the underlying system, but realize, that not only social status but prejeduice and social norm define, what is acceptable and how ones image is defined by action, not question.

"I give food to the poor, and they call me a saint. I ask why the poor have no food, and they call me a Communist." - Helder Camara (https://books.google.at/books?id=f7MJvhxmr4kC&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=%22I+give+food+to+the+poor,+and+they+call+me+a+saint.+I+ask+why+the+poor+have+no+food,+and+they+call+me+a+Communist.%22+-+Helder+Camara&source=bl&ots=YKR2r6g2er&sig=ACfU3U3KsUfpOKMvPz0YAaXsyMddEATWsw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjd8JLu6ZmEAxWeQ_EDHWm1D6MQ6AF6BAgdEAM#v=onepage&q=%22I%20give%20food%20to%20the%20poor%2C%20and%20they%20call%20me%20a%20saint.%20I%20ask%20why%20the%20poor%20have%20no%20food%2C%20and%20they%20call%20me%20a%20Communist.%22%20-%20Helder%20Camara&f=false)

YCP's formative years in the Techno Industrial Complex and Budget Airline Limbo.

Mockumentary of the rock and rock and acid and speed and techno industrial zirkus days. use the autobiographic stories from "the author has been replace by the buyers readers name".
[[Book]]

in this mock you mentary, interview some of the artists from back then if available and if not, just ignorantly have them be played by actors. 

have kalkbrenner vibe to it. and fraktus. but actually more of bo jack horse man. sad vibe. lost, always searching, never compromising lost. 

themes.

how I lost my voice and friends in the age of budget airlines. 

the movie is a homage to collectivism. 

YCP makes friends and looses some as he behaves like a spoiled rich upper class kid, but only budget airlines that are not only bad for the environment, and a monthly allowance made it possible for this merely middle class cat from a small town in nazi saxony.

YCP is in a rush. but learns about the power to control people with music. and in the end discovers that their most powerful weapen, was their voice. and that it can spread a very important message. nothing matters but love and community. 

possible end: so in the end cat pope decides to go into IT. make money and start their own choir, and tik tok career as a sidehustle.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Installations\Chess Debate.md

Grund Idee: Die Positionen zu Israel Palästina sind aufgeladener den je. Propaganda wird schnell auf gegriffen, Staats resentments, Organisationen. Alle buhlen um die Wahrheit doch mit der hat es längst nix mehr zu tun. 

Sozial Media is ein reiner Brain fuck. Auf Diskussionen einlassen geht dort gar nicht. Es funktioniert nur das wider holen eines Gospels , hyper pop loops, oder hoch stilisierte narrative, deren angebliche Fakten Basissierte Parteilosigkeit immer und immer wieder Dialoge verwehrt. 

Wie ein speed chess gebaut.

Tische mit Schach uhren

I love the interaction with the frequencies and quantum energies. Everyone around me who receives the cards either with pure quantum energy or in combination with frequencies has higher values than before (tested with dowser). Especially the feedback from (very sensitive) children is amazing. Thank you for making these quantum energies available to all. Kind regards.

Hello everyone, I would like to share my experience with the Leela Quantum Card. I am on the road and have neither an IB block nor a water filter with me. That's why I swing the water with the Leela Quantum Card. I put the glass of water on the card for about 5-10 minutes and the water tastes so much better than without it. I am so glad it works with it. It makes the water drinkable for me and I like drinking it.

I used the IB to copy the frequencies Heal, EMF, NB, DNA & Cell, FY onto aluminum foil and then copied this frequency mix onto chrome steel plates which I placed in the various drinking troughs in our cow and cattle barn. Just cleaning these drinkers makes the water feel very different, the animals seem to like it. I also copied the EMF frequency onto chrome steel plates and placed them, invisible to the cows, in various locations in the milking robot. Again, the animals seem to do better with the creeping current in the milking robot. A few weeks ago, I had a severe thigh bruise from being pushed against a chrome steel basin by a cow. I almost fainted and my leg and varicose veins swelled badly. At home, I slipped the IB over my leg and sat for about an hour. The next day there was a bruise from two palms, the leg still hurt with every movement, the day after next no more pain and the big bruise was gone. Thank you!

I always carry the H.E.A.L.® capsule with me and usually have one or more cards in my pockets. Lately I have been putting my head in the IB. I have a molar that is bothering me and it seems to be helping. I am hoping that maybe the Infinity Bloc or capsule will help because I had a root canal when I was 9. I haven't seen a lot of questions here about teeth, so I'd love to hear about others' experiences with their teeth!

Recently I tested quantity versus quality of material/presentation. I bought some aluminum ribbon and some silver coated aluminum wire, charged them up and then compared them to gold plated bronze rings, and although the wire and ribbon contain much more metal than the rings, the rings feel stronger to me. Maybe it's just me, but I thought this was interesting.

I just bought Leela products, my menopause makes me dizzy and low energy, the first day I wear women booster capsule, I can feel my mind is more alert and the dizziness go, even at night my mind still energetic, so I decided to cut the hours wear to 4 hours, and for those few nights I can just sleep until the next morning, before the women booster capsules, I used to wake up 2-3 at night to urinate. And I just keep neutral card Oso a great help to release gas when I felt stomach bloded. thx to Leela Quantum Tech Amy

I often buy tulips to put in a vase and they usually fall over after a week. The last time I charged the water, the tulips lasted so much longer and stayed upright.... it may not sound like much, but I'm telling you, it's a huge difference... that's how I know that charged water is so much more beneficial to our bodies

I ride my bike around, I have it fully charged, I feel lighter on my bike, the gears are smoother and the brakes respond quickly. I feel like I can ride and ride until I stop and realize I'm doing the work and I'm dripping with sweat. It is so much fun. I recommend if you have a bike.

Guten Tag,

ich suche nach einer Förderung für ein Software Tool das aus Ideen zu Kombination von moderner und traditionelle Notationsmethodik in der Musik entstanden ist. Darüberhinaus jedoch potenziale für vielfältige Anwendungen birgt.  

Die Hauptfunktion des Tools ist es, Noten und anderen inter-mediale Inhalte (Content Format: Video, Audio, 3D, Text, MusicXML, Bilder) interaktiv auf beliebig viele Endgeräte synchron in Gruppen abzuspielen.  

Die Innovation dabei ist, dass es als WebApp und übers Internet funktioniert.

App Installationen sowie LAN's sind überflüssig.  

Durch die Nutzung von sogenannten WebSocket Servern, ähnlich derer die in Multi-Game Computer spielen benutzt werden und der Lagerung des Contents auf Global verfügbaren CDNs sind kaum Latenzen spürbar und Clients gänzlich autark dezentral positionier bar. Zusätzlich bestehen noch frei definierbare Feedback-Kanäle von jedem Endgerät was eine Vielzahl kreativer Applikationen ermöglicht.  

Mein Service stellt die Basis Technology zur Verfügung für vielfältigste Anwendungen. Von Automatischen Noten-Blättern für Orchester bis zur kreativen Anwendung im Stadion Konzert oder Synchronization von Video Leinwänden oder Abstimmungen in Parlamenten oder GameShows.  

Das Produkt besteht aus einem WebSocket Server, einem Applications Server und einem CDN Server.  

Das Geschäftsmodel sieht vor, ein Free Tier mit einem Projekt a 4 Kanäle und 200mb content zu betreiben. Für den Betrieb größerer Setups sind abgestufte Subscriptions in monatlichen Raten an gedacht um die Server Kosten (vor allem Socket Server und CDN) und kontinuierliche Weiterentwicklung (Sicherheit, Skalierung, Interfaces, Performance, Content Formate) im Griff zu halten.  

Das Tool funktioniert bereits und würde in mehreren Konzerten bereits von diversen Komponist:innen und Medienschaffenden verwendet. Daher kann ich ihnen bereits eine funktionierende Demo präsentieren.

Im Anhang finden sie einen kurzen Schematischen Aufbau des Systems.  

Über die Möglichkeit eines Beratungsgesprächs zu einer Förderung über die Wirtschaftsagentur würde ich mich sehr freuen.

Mit besten Grüßen,  

Tilman Porschütz

Preaching To The Choir

Telling people what they already know!
Affirming our selves!
Talking To The Magic Mirror!

A question of self realisation. What is the self, and what are the mechanism that even though we have more and more tools to look at our selves, it is harder and harder to feel okay with what we are.

Not just man have externalized their reputation. 

We, us, that's the choir! It's a dialog with our externalisations. They mirror is the first thing when it comes to explaining consciousness. An animal that recognizes itself, we call intelligent. 

Currently we are in the absurd assumption that NPCs are beings, people even tend to feel that way.

Looking at how we have perfected narcissim and self oberservation and even in a mirror like format (portrait vertical video is taking over) a new narrative is spinning. 

We are not seeing the stories of apostels and warriors and heros played out. we are constantly gazing at our selves, or people that look just like us, filtered by algorythms. 

I take this as a creative opportunity to develop characters and stories through movement, poetry, interaction, augumentation and sound. 

My work is multi facettet, can be viewed online, on screens and projections and in engaging live shows. 

But, Mirroring Excersices are also the fundation of syncing with the other in performance, how we learn. we carefully copy and follow. It's a sign of trust.

I am an optimist, and consider our current state of consciousness, that of collective first contact with ourselves on a different level. We have baked behavior sort of intuitively into our devices, now we are amazed that they behave like us, and belief them to be alive!

It's a fun time!

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Research\The Power of FATGA.md

Brilliant comparison by devisive historian 
[Niall Ferguson](https://www.spectator.co.uk/writer/niall-ferguson/) of the impact of big tech in terms of controlling the public space. In the end that what it comes down to with the preacher, who preaches the loudest, can they control the media that carries the message, and they will be heard. This is absolute rain. No need to bother with worldly matters, if one controls the CLOUD.
# Key Passages

"By the network platforms, I mean Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Google and Apple, or FATGA for short — **companies that have established a dominance over the public sphere not seen since the heyday of the pre-Reformation Catholic Church.** FATGA had humble enough origins in garages and dorm rooms. As recently as 2008, not one of them could be found among the world’s largest companies by market capitalisation. Today, they occupy first, third, fourth and fifth places in the market cap league table, just above their Chinese counterparts, Tencent and Alibaba."

https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-tech-supremacy-silicon-valley-can-no-longer-conceal-its-power/

> 1. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.2. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of … any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.

In essence, Section 230 gives websites immunity from liability for what their users post if it is in any way harmful, but also entitles websites to take down with equal impunity any content that they don’t like the look of. The surely unintended result of this legislation, drafted for a fledgling internet, is that some of the biggest companies in the world enjoy a protection reminiscent of Joseph Heller’s _Catch-22_. Try to hold them responsible as publishers, and they will say they are platforms. Demand access to their platforms and they will insist that they are publishers.

## COMMENT
... spaeter im Text vergleicht er doch nicht so ganz unbiased Trump Riots (offensichtlich von ihm angestachelt mit dem wiederholen des STOLE THE ELECTION maerchen) und den black life matters protesten, die von Kamala Harris positiv betrachtet wurden. wo der ausloeser doch die ermordung von georg floyd und ein offensichtlicher bias von seiten der polizei herscht. die buergerrechts bewegung mit populistisch getriebenen und bewaffneten verschwoerungstheoretikern zu vergleichen ist reine provokation und populistic seiner seits. der rest seiner analyse jedoch ist wichtig und veranschaulicht den double standard sehr gut und die gefahren die von zu liberalem umgang mit bewegungen mit reinen eigen interesse und zerstoerrischen absichten (Monopole, Hegemonien, Totalitarismus) gegen pluralistische demokratische gesellschaften ausgehen.

Furthermore, I see a problem in Fergusons comparison, which is a general problem of US democracy, which is reinforcing a catholic binary world order. good or bad. any gradient in political analysis seems to really matter at the end of the day. the press in his view is polarised to the left, which he often claims, yet, the cases he presents should be evaluated under a more case specific lense. he is in fact populising himself, when talking about harris or biden in two totally different cases to proof his point. I argue that the examples he uses are not useful to argue his point. while mobilising to storm the parliament is an active attempt of a coup d'etat,  protest against police brutality that turn violent  (of course police brutality riots will enventually turn violent, we know that in germany, ACAB) is a not handled with enough respect for civil protest and disobedience. the latter one does not intend to rid a country of it's legal powers, but asks for acknoledgement of unequality and demands civil protection without bias.
the polical and economical relevanz is mixed in his arguments with ethical and humanitarian agendas. 

he does argue in another book that power is not only held by money alone, narrative and the control of the narrativ is, and we all know what sillicon valley will turn to once they see their actual chance to make more. if they can take out a government, they will. trump, thiel, besos and musk paved the way for them to fall. unfortunately for them until now, programmers liked leftist ideas, and they needed them. the CEOs that drove the goldrush only cared for themselfes, hence the exodus to mars ideas.

the last paragraph where he quotes orwell, and describes trump and musks agenda. which retrospetively is fantastic comedy seeing how these new alliances have formed.

The aim is to produce the music for 108 versions of the themes of the songs of the album (W.T. "Preaching To The Choir"/ https://mandymozart.com/promo/preaching-to-the-choir/)  in a collaborative approach. 
Every collaboration is resulting in as many tracks as possible which can be released for audio visual TikTok loops.

108 stands for the 108 temptations one has to overcome on their way to Nirvana in Buddhism and stands for the bigger questions of why entities of many species and humans specifically engage in repetitions of rather complex procedures such as song and the very nature of us as a performative social creature as part of a greater digital world of content platforms. Specifically how submission to the algorithms content hunger may be seen as a potential for artistic liberation and creativity rather than a necessity to merely stay relevant.

Mandy Mozart embodies a pope-like figure who just recently found out about their own existence. That being a NPC in a open world game which was designed for cats. Knowing about their true nature triggers a plot of diverse quests in which the character tries hiding their fundamental discovery, differentiating reality from virtuality and exploring their new found super powers that came with the enlightenment. All in all, a playful phantasy which taps into everyday self-overestimation of male role models within our patriarchic society.

The residency is taking place at Westbahnstudios the entire April and June 2024.
That’s two versions of a song recorded and live-streamed on Twitch & YouTube Live every day. One is recorded straight after arrival and one is recorded before leaving the studio. There is absolutely no style required. The music is the mood of the day. A necessity of prayer, a meditation, a ritual to overcome the temptations of the world. To reach a higher state of mind where bodies, minds and machines align and resonate. 
## Collaborations & Guests

Planned collaborations and streams as well as the recorded sessions will be exhibited online on a specific project website which functions as a hub to inform the audience, register and organise collaborators and archive the work in a comprehensive form.

Collaborators will be electronic musicians, singers (choir + soloists), brass and string instrument players, and audio visual artists and game developers.

During the day time we will be working on methodologies and sound with the invited artists.

A lava lamp, a sphynx cat sculpture and audio mobile are playing when no one is in the studio to deliver a 24/7 live stream in sort of a online Oracle which functions as a portal into the place of the content's creation.
The channel will be stopped twice every day and restarted to generate a daily routine and to overcome the 12h continuous streaming limit of the platforms.

A virtual and analog interconnected installation like a temple, a shrine, a digital spiritual town square with the announcements and subscriptions. It’s placed around the installation camera and tech.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Residency\Confessions.md

Wenn ich darüber nachdenke, wie ich meine Kunst zugänglich machen kann, dann gibt mir diese Präsentation dazu die Möglichkeit die socio ökologischen Bedingungen, für deren Verständnis mir die Arbeit geholfen hat einem aufmerksamen Publikum nahe zu legen. Mit der Hoffnung, und das sehe ich in jeder mir wichtigen künstlerischen Position, ein klein Wenig Verständnis für die eigene Befangenheit und Aussichtslosigkeit zu erhalten. 

Daher hier mein Bekenntnis:

Ich glaube in einer neo faschistischen Weltordnung zu leben, in der produktionsaufwand gleichgesetzt wird mit ein Wert.
Dieser Wert wird jedoch konsumiert, das heißt quantitativ verschlungen. Das heißt auch das sollte ich mich versuchen dieser verausgabenden Ökonomie versuchen zu verschließen, in dem ich beispielsweise eine effiziente Form suche, die Verhältnismäßig wenig Aufwand und Ressourcen benötigt, so wird auch hier von mir verlangt diese immer und immer wieder mit leichten Varianten zu reproduzieren. Ich habe mein Denken der Ökonomie der industriellen Produktion untergeordnet. 
Das Tempo der Reproduktion wird hier vorgegeben von Softwareplattformen.
Ich glaube es mit einer in ihrer Entstehung befindlichen Religion zu tun haben, die aus der Religion des Kapitals hervorgegangen ist und deshalb möchte ich darauf aufmerksam machen, sich zu einer neuen weltumfassenden kolonialen Kraft entwickelt. Kolonial weil diese religionsform unser aller Lebensgrundlagen bedroht. Egal ob der Besitzverhältnisse. 

Welche Elemente kann ich nun eindeutig als religionsmerkmale benennen, die meine These belegen, und die dann auch Eingang gefunden haben in meine Arbeit. 

Die CEO sind die modernen Prediger einer Verheißung auf die alle, nicht nur die oft verhassten Investoren ihr Geld wetten. 
Es gibt einen heiligen Text der von eben diesen predigern in mehr oder minder unzugänglichen undemokratischen, beinahe mystischen Konzilen (Davos, Dubai, Peking) ausverhandelt wird, und sich immer wieder erneuert, und selbst erneuernd durch das Internet und mit Hilfe von AI auf jeden von uns portioniert. 

Es ist deshalb meiner Sicht als Individuum oft nicht erkenntlich, dass ich bereits Anhänger einer größeren neuen Religion bin, da in den Informationen die ich gesendet bekomme , dem Prinzip der costumization bzw data individualisation unterlegen bin. Ich bekomme Versatz Stücke und Artefakte der mir bekannten und aus meiner kulturellen Erfahrung erlernenten weltvorstellungen vorgesetzt und zu einem neuen individuellen Glaubensmodel zusammengesetzt. Dafür sorgen bereits seit Jahren Algorithmen und trollfarmenn und Marketing. Das ist nicht neu, und findet seinen Beginn in der Grundidee der Propagandisten und Psychoanalytikerinnen, die das Unterbewusstsein formbar gemacht haben. 
Ich glaube außerdem das es sich um eine expansive Religion handelt, deren Einfluss Bereich lange wächst. 
Die Kirche, Moschee, Tempel, ihr heiliger Ort der Ort der Predigt,  der Andacht, des Gebets, der parish, der Gemeinde, ist ein hyperkomplexes technologisches Netzwerk aus Maschine, fibre optischen Kabeln, Laser Satelliten, Schaltern, und ihre Existenz ist deshalb neu, und deshalb beredenswert, da die meisten von uns in irgend einer Form von diesen Kanälen anhängig sind. 

Unsere eigene Ökonomie ist so eng verwoben mit der Ökonomie einer Vorstellung davon wie die Welt zu funktionieren hat, das solche die ein abzweigen propagieren als Gefahr gesehen werden (Fridays for future, letzte generation, zapatistas, und auch Künstlerinnen) und nach und nach durch AI oder Menschlich generierten content der den Inhalten dieser Gruppen ähnelt vereinnahmt und in Quantität überschrieben wird.

Das bringt mich zur Motivation meiner sysiphos ähnlichen Arbeit. Die stalinistisch morbide Quantität dieser Religion is nichts entgegen zu setzen. Die verschlingt all unsere aufmerksamkeiten und Ressourcen, da sie die Grundlage unser Ökonomie ist. 

Ich glaube Ein radikales Umdenken ist nicht möglich innerhalb dieser von mir beschriebenen Verstrickungen, zu effektiv ist dieses neue Konglomerat das es einer technokratischen Weltanschauung ermöglicht hat unsere emotionale und ideologische sowie ideelle Sicht auf die Realität zu vereinnahmen. 

vielleicht begehe ich hier einen Riesen Fehler und gebe dieser Religion durch dieses Bekenntnis erst für mich eine Rechtferigung und somit Existenz. 

Jedoch möchte ich poetisch schwimmen können und nicht jeden Tag mit dem Bewusstsein eines dystopen erwachen, der Sich vor der Übermacht des Universums erschlagen und somit vereinnahmen lässt.

Ich glaube an das hacking, der Möglichkeit durch die bewusste Infiltration von misinformation, durch das selbe senden von misinformation, durch das aufcodieren von Informationen auf Informationen in einer Meta Ebene, wenigstens ein wenig Hoffnung und Freude und glitches hier und da in das Gewebe dieses neuen Monsters das uns noch lange als Menschheit begleiten wird zu säen. 

Ich glaube daran das Quantität auch durch die Wiederholung der selben Informationen, der selben Lieder, die Ökonomie des immer neuen zumindest für 10tel Sekunden der Aufmerksamkeit unterbrechen kann.

Diese Arbeit ist ein Versuch die Menschen die dieses kodierte Signal entschlüsseln koennten in einem eigenen Ritual für einem Moment dem unausweichlichen zu entziehen und in diesem Gemeinsamkeiten ohne den Filter der eigenen digitalen Wahrnehmung an einander zu erkennen. 

Ich glaube das ein Moment Klarheit in all der Informationsflut, deren Ziel es ist zu vereinnahmen, zu werben , zu senden, einen Riss in das Fundament dieser Kontrollfreaks zu bersten. Und dieser Riss im Quanten Gefüge der Möglichkeiten möglicherweise zu einem Spalt wird,  zu einem Fluchtweg, zu einem Schutzraum im Raum der räume. 

Ich bete für diese Chance und möchte euch die ihr nun nicht mehr glaubt das dies eine sektengründung ist, einladen, ein musikalisch performativen Versuch eines zum scheitern verurteilten excorzismus und eines Rituals der vermeintlichen Belanglosigkeiten bei zu wohnen. 

Ich nehme dabei die Rolle einer pabst-ähnlichen Figur ein, die sich der Stabilität ihrer Welt Ordnung in unerschütterlicher Weise bewusst ist. Eine klassisch eurozentrische patriarchale Illusion, deren grausame Wahrheit und Realität uns allen nur zu gut bewusst ist. Dieser Person wird ein Chor gegen übergestellt, der als Projektionsfläche der pabstähnlichen Figur dient, jedoch wie im klassischen Sprichwort, „preaching to the choir“ bereits die Predigen auswendig kennt und mitunter erst dadurch in der Lage ist mehrstimmig und mit selbstbewusstsein den Kanon des predigenden selbstblenders zu erwiedern. Den sind wir uns ehrlich, würden wir den meisten männlichen Figuren dieser Erde Wort wörtlich das gesagt abkaufen, so würde uns entweder das Lachen vergehen oder wir würden uns zu Tode lachen. 

Ich bekenne mich für diesen Augenblick zu dieser Rolle. Amen. 

~~Ich danke euch für die Aufmerksamkeit und die Unterstützung in dieser meiner Suche.~~

I started this document to give the story the outline it needs and refine the character(s) and their development in advance, if possible.
A lot of the process is just doing it and analysing the audio visual kinetic output and associating story and context from it. Yet, by developing back stories, future shootings and song writing will gain in possibilities and ideas.

Description

Cat Pope is a poetic music and performance project about a god-like, cat-like creature trapped between digital and earthly realms. Inspired by spiritual influencers who share sermons, affirmations, and life advice to gain followers, I plan to produce around 70 short video art pieces that blend TikTok and Instagram content aesthetics. This fictional figure, a mix between a cat and a papal character, exists both digitally and physically. Collaborators include Korean special effects artist Una Ryu, Japanese videographer Hiroo Tanaka, and contributions from Patrizia Ruthensteiner (costumes), Tatjana Stürmer (graphics), Lukas Rehm (VFX), and more. The videos will be featured in 2025/26 through a dedicated social media account (goal: 25k followers in 3 months), an AR graphic novel (limited edition of 200), and physical installations at shows, exhibitions, art fairs, and film festivals across Europe.



Producing in Berlin allows me and Una Ryu to co-create the character Cat Pope, essential to the project’s artistic vision, with her special effects makeup as a cornerstone. The proximity to Ryu’s workshop and a residency at Künstlerhof Frohnau enable intensive, hands-on experimentation and collaboration, enhancing both creativity and efficiency by minimizing material transport costs and utilizing the seclusion of Frohnau for focused research. Working closely with award-winning videographer Hiroo Tanaka, known for his work with Atonal Festival and Ninja Tune, will expand our exploration of docu-fictional techniques, vital for the immersive nature of the project. The two-week Berlin residency is essential to achieve our objectives: creating a unique artistic work and exploring new conceptual approaches to blur digital and earthly realms through collaborative, concentrated development.

Main preparation steps for Cat Pope are underway: mask development is complete, with any alterations to be managed remotely. The costume is finalized, requiring no further work. A script for approximately 70 shorts is finished, with refinements ongoing with Hiroo Tanaka via digital correspondence. We’ve planned workshops on staging and scene design with Tanaka for pre-residency and the first week of residency. Filming will occur during the second week, followed by on-site and remote post-production. This structured preparation ensures a cohesive, efficient creative process.

The Cat Pope project aims to develop a distinctive visual and poetic language, establishing a foundation for the character’s future digital and analog performances, which will support further editions of video works, a graphic novel, and character evolution. This project will strengthen collaborations with our existing team, paving the way for sustained partnerships. In Berlin, I plan to network with galleries and exhibition spaces to promote a showcase and host an open studio day, connecting with the local art scene, curators, sponsors, and potential supporters. Additionally, I intend to initiate discussions on online promotion strategies to enhance the reach of this hybrid artwork. These steps are designed to expand both creative and professional opportunities.

To prioritize sustainability, the Berlin production is designed with eco-friendly actions. By relocating the production to Berlin, only my individual travel—done by train—is required, reducing travel emissions. Local collaborations with Hiroo Tanaka and Una Ryu eliminate the need for long-distance shipping, as their studios are reachable via public transport. The Künstlerhof residency provides on-site kitchen and accommodation, minimizing daily commuting and allowing us to source food locally. Additionally, we plan to re-use available materials at Künstlerhof for props, reducing resource consumption, and will rent any necessary equipment locally, supporting sustainable practices throughout the project.

* #Depression Frustration, looked in, demon possessing you, at the lowest point. Abuse the vulnerabilities of the viewers to draw them in for the kill, negativity , content that does make your really depressed , ask a question at the end, if it is all worth it, 
* #Acceptance give in to your cat soul, the universe is connected , be the enlightened, the quantum particle , everything flows through them, it’s not in your power

Like it or not. Economics has become a bit like catholic  theology in medical Europe. It basically has become the language of the rulers. So. If you do not speak the language of economics you can not participate in any debate. Especially in the last years in neoliberalism, when everything has been thought in economic turns, when you have to protect a library or a musuem

Lilyjay (playing dumb) asking in a high pitch voice: hey atheists, I got a question? You say religious people are stupid(trigger) for believing the universe was created by a god that’s invisible,right? (Pushing everyone in one corner and generalising) But do you know what’s even crazier? Believing that something can come from nothings. Now that’s crazy. Because it is scientifically impossible. (Using any possible argument in reverse) How can we „belief“ the universe was created from nothing? Can this simple coffee make itself? Not need a barista ?  (Snappy sipping on the coffee straw) Hm, how does that work? #atheists #genesis #creator https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDCj2K8uRsx/?igsh=MXhrMm93YmRlamFmZA== Caption: Can Something Come From Nothing?😮 Is this really possible? Do you really belief something comes from nothing ? 😵‍💫 even a simple coffee needs a barista to exist - so how come the entire universe just come to exist on its own. ☕️🌌 drop your thoughts int the comments and let the Debate begin. 🚨🔥 #islam #faith #religiousdebate Videothumb: a universe without god?

Boxer asking chatgpt. He’s chatgpt, I want you to go through the bible from genesis to revelation and read (interesting to tell chat gpt to read) the bible and tell me what you think. Is Jesus Christ god or just a prophet. No, I don’t want to be biased or influenced by any other religious content on the internet by church or. By simply what you find in the bible.  Is just Christ a god or a just a prophet . In one sentence. CHATGPT: Based merely on the bible, Jesus is fully god and fully man, not merely a prophet as he is described the eternal word who was with god and with god and claims John 1:1 and and he claims divinity John 10:30. BOXER (unsatisfied) so yea or no? Is he god or just a prophet. Just yes or no. #lilyjay #godbacked #chatgpt https://www.instagram.com/reel/DABQtuhIdG_/?igsh=N3J0ZzRrNjFoYmhk Caption: Asking chatgpt if Jesus Christ is god or prophet. Remark: People asking chat gpt about what to do has become a real trend. Therefore a creative / creational gospel is only consequential. A book of god that consistently preaches too. So pocket preacher can be a ai enhanced spiritual machine. Like a Yoda in your pocket giving advice in pseudo physiological riddles. Hard to challenge because they defy logic. Second remark: relying on monopolistic universal tools as in age of em is going to not change the way ai controls us but they way companies can become as powerful as the  church at the peek of colonialism. BTW, nice indicator that content is already recycled by Chatgpt and watering down the answers. 

Found footage from a mega church event a woman is singing rhythmical: You got beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes, Lamm, Rams, horse, dogs, chickens,turkeys! {belting} You name it !

No matter what you are going through, you can always find something you can be grateful for. I pray that you all have a blessed thanks giving.

POV SOPHIST (O.S.): Hey cat pope, do you know? You don’t exist right ? I am a sophist. Nothing exists. I don’t exist. The universe does not exist. You don’t exist. It’s all part of your imagination. {SMACKS POV SOPHIST} My god you don’t exist? I don’t exist?

Russlands Abgeordnete sehen in den verkleideten Kindern einen „Virus“ und arbeiten bereits an „Maßnahmen zur Prophylaxe und Heilung“, [wie es Gennadi Skljar von der Regierungspartei Einiges Russland ausdrückt](https://taz.de/Programm-Navigator-fuer-die-Kindheit/!5746380/). Russlands Kirche erkennt darin eine „Antiwerte-Bewegung“.

Saint Michael is **an archangel, a spiritual warrior in the battle of good versus evil**. He is considered a champion of justice, a healer of the sick, and the guardian of the Church. In art Saint Michael is depicted with a sword, a banner, or scales, and is often shown vanquishing Satan in the form of a dragon. **Michael** in the Hebrew language means "Who is like God?" or "Who is equal to God?" Michael has been depicted from earliest Christian times as a commander, who holds in his right hand a spear with which he attacks Lucifer/Satan, and in his left hand a green palm branch.

## File: Projects\Pocket Preacher\Shorts\Shorts - Import Log, Format and Conventions.md

# Purpose of this file 

Streamline the note keeping for shorts to fit a standardised format. Ultimately this should make import automation into the repository easier. 
## Import Log

Each line is an import with date and a short description of what was imported. Consider it a commit to the NLP source data repository of the cat pope script.  

Import: 2024-11-28 Import_message: initial Import 

## Format & Convention 

Add new short discoveries to the top of the file.

All entries should be a single line. 

Each note should start with a short scene description, introducing the character and pov. Followed by the main dialog transcription. You can already replace characters with cat pope or relevant alternative characters who could also Playout this scene. Example: Priest/Butcher/CEO 

Continue with hashtags, both from the original short and your own. 

Copy and paste the url or image after that. 

Add additional notes after that. Most common choices are Caption or Reenactment instructions and remarks on how to mutate the source.

### Example 

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR An elegantly dressed Lady/Pope approaches POV SCEPTIC. SCEPTIC (O.S.) Hey you, you look great today. LADY/POPE (shy) Thank you. You too. {FART} #comedy #pickupartist #sin  https://instagram.com/somehashid Caption: This is how you will succeed every time … Remark: should change the fart to offering a cucumber and leave in rush giggling.

😅 es nicht so einfach für mich mein Kreuzworträtsel zu lösen. Das spiele ich immer mit meiner Mutter, wie so viele Menschen auf der Welt um mit ihren Liebsten über Distanz in Verbindung zu bleiben. Wordl, eine Art Postkarte die sagt ich denke an dich. Das ist der eine Teil, die Verbundenheit mit meiner Mutter die so weit weg ist, dass andere was mir dabei immer wieder auffällt ist, das es mir hilft meine Aufmerksamkeit zu testen. Kann ich mir die Wörter vorstellen, so ist das oft ein Zeichen für ausgeglichenheit und Fokus. Derzeit macht Mein Gehirn 
immer noch recht viele Loopings nachdem ich letzte Woche diesen Job direkt wieder verloren habe, für Den ich eigentlich so gut geeignet wäre. Komplexe zusammen hänge erkennen, Programmier und oder besser noch Design Lösungen dafür entwickeln. Die Programmierer hatten die großEre Power in der Diskussion und waren von Anfang immer knapp bei Zeit. Das längste das mir einer gegeben hat direkt am Stück waren 15-20 Minuten Aufmerksamkeit. Immer getrieben und leicht abwesend auch, mit einer friss oder stirb attitude bei der nicht viel von selbst Hilfe angeboten wurde als ein paar links zu Dokumentationen, die ich mir auch hätte selbst raus suchen können. Ich bin es gewohnt mit Leute gerade beim Start eines Projektes sich zu verständigen und mit white boards gemeinsam Strategien zu entwickeln wie etwas aufgebaut wird bevor ich irgend etwas anfasse. Na wie dem auch sei, meine Fragen wurden teilweise tagelang nicht beantwortet und dann gabs auch keinerlei Feedback bis ich’s dann von meinem Chef im Telefonat am Mittwoch bekommen habe, das sie sich gern wollen das ich wieder aufhöre. Weil sie glauben ich bin fachlich inkompetent und sei sprachlich zu persönlich und nicht professionell. Letztlich habe ich noch kurz diskutiert, im Kopf meine Optionen durchgespielt, aber sofort gemerkt, ich bin in eine Ecke gedrängt aus der ich mich quasi eigentlich nicht befreien kann. Es fühlte sich so an das mein neuer alter Chef auch ähnlich machtlos war, sun ebenfalls so enttäuscht wie ich. Wir hatten Visionen bereit und eigentlich fast täglich lange Gespräche wie man die eine Brücke zur technologie lästigen Seite der Firma schlagen kann. So war die Enttäuschung auch groß bei den Kolleginnen aus dem Design und Customer experience Business Development Bereich. Mit denen ich sehr gern weiter an den bereits begonnenen pitches gearbeitet hätte. 

Ich sagte in der Ecke fühlt es sich scheisse an, er sagte er kann gern versuchen ein Gespräch mit dem besagten Kollegen der mein lead auf Programmierer Seite war zu reden, da er ja nun von mir auch meine Beobachtungen gehört hat. Ich sagte, ja gern. Ich würde drüber schlafen, ob mir etwas einfällt. Was er genau dachte weiß ich nicht, ich dachte mir, habe ich die Energie jetzt mit dem Kollegen der nicht mit mir reden wollte zu reden und diese Situation zu klären? Wie kann. Ich jemandem beweisen was meine Fähigkeiten sind wenn er es nicht einmal schafft mir seine Kritik persönlich zu äußern ? Eine schwere Nacht  verging, ich war verletzt aufgrund dieses Negativ Feedbacks ohne Kommunikation, silent treatment. Meine Gedanken sind, er hatte gern einfach, hier ist Aufgabe , bitte gibt Ergebnis. Ohne Vorlage wie er es gern hätte. Jetzt ein paar Tage später ist es mir klarer, so etwas hatte ich oft mit Schweizer Kunden, nein passt uns nicht, Ende der Diskussion. Ggf. Wird man noch bezahlt und dann weg. Es fühlt sich wie wegwerf Ware an, aber es geht um ein Dialog und es fühlt sich nicht auf Augen Höhe an. 

Na auf jeden fall, habe ich ein paar meiner CBT Kertchen bemüht, mich mit Freunden getroffen, in der alten Residenz Weihnachtsfeier, dort Strugglen auch alle, und gestern noch auf einer Diskussion von ner Freundin zum Thema Gesundheit und well-being in der kulturarbeit. Ich bin anfällig für Verallgemeinerungen, und soziologische sowie markt analytische Interpretationen, aber es war trotzdem gut zu hören, wie es quasi um die Ökonomien der freien Szene bestellt ist. Austauschbarkeit , Wettbewerb und scham die Probleme offen zu kommunizieren, da es ja auch wenn alle solidarisch tuen, so ist, dass eine optimistische vor Freude sprühende Person immer noch mehr angesprochen wird, als Auch einmal niedergeschlagene. Von Selbstwertgefühlsverlust ganz zu schweigen. Das ist auch mein größtes gedanken Roulette. Paula meine Partnerin hat mir sehr geholfen zumal zumindest zu erkennen, dass job nichts direkt mit meiner Kunst zu tun hat. Ich hab halt einfach auch grundlegend ein bisschen immer so Panik und Selbstwert Probleme wenn ein harter Schlag wie dieser kommt. Ich dachte zumindest habe ich einiges an Kritik Fähigkeit gelernt, aber wenn es dann mit einer Strafe quasi hinter her kommt, in dem Fall Feuerung (einvernehmliche Auflösung des dienstverhaeltnisses, lol), und mit der nicht Chance auf Anpassung oder Korrektur, dann wirft mich das immer aus der Bahn. Ich treffe  mich Montag mal mit einem Therapeuten , ich muss da jetzt bissi Geld in die Hand nehmen. Es braucht neben dem was ich mir so an Psychologischen Methode n antrainiere noch bissi Support von Profis. Hab kein Bock von den Bewertungen solcher Leute und Dinge mein Lebensglück kaputt machen zu lassen. Immer wieder regelmäßig. Finde es gemein das die Gesellschaft uns allen das zumutet und das wir damit dann auch noch allein zurecht kommen zu sollen. Hab oft das Gefühl und ich glaube das haben gerade viel mehr als früher noch, also bei Frauen und Minderheiten kann ich es mir ziemlich gut vorstellen, dass sie das schon gewohnt sind seit ewig. Aber ich hab immer öfter  das Gefühl Überhaupt nicht mehr rein zu gehören. Irgendwie falsch zu sein. Falsch zu denken, falsch zu sprechen, falsch zu fühlen. Und das ist so wieder sinnig, da ich doch meine gesamte Zeit damit verbringe wissen zu erarbeiten, wissen, wie Sachen besser kommuniziert werden können, wie wir Räume schaffen können in denen wir interagieren können , und uns austauschen, wie verschiedenste soziale Gruppen denken und fühlen, und was letztlich die Humankondition ist. Je mehr ich mich einlese desto mehr fühle ich mich wie ein Alien, das nicht mehr zu funktionieren scheint und immer wider anecke. Ich probiere einmal aufzulisten welche Typen Personen das waren. 
Autoritäten ohne aus Rolle nicht aus Wissen oder Respekt also sogenannte nicht natuerliche Autoritäten. Also solche Leute die auf Grund ihres Fähigkeiten eine Autorität sind, sondern auf Grund von macht. 
Leute die sich intellektuell bedroht fühlen von meinen spitzfindigen Frage. 
Leute die unter zeit Druck stehen und ich zum überdenken oder weiter denken anregen möchte, wobei natürlich viele dann in der Lage sind, zu sagen, danke, jetzt gerade nicht weil es geht auch folgendes, und wenn mir das plausibler ist dann bin ich auch voll dabei. 
Letzter Gedanke , ich fühl mich gedrängt das Album an dem ich gerade arbeite fertig zu machen, aber ich bin mir nicht 100 prozentig sicher wann das ist und ob ich alles richtig mache es zu vermarkten , also unter die Leute zu bringen . Geplant und in Arbeit sind ein musik Video (nur editing fehlt) , sind eine Tour (kann erst mit einem physikalischen Verkaufsgegenstand geplant werden),  ein tik tok kanal (Ideen stehen, aber Script muss geschrieben werden und es muss dann natürlich auch noch editiert werden. Zirka 100 Videos), eine graphik Novelle (Script steht, editing, graphic design und edition digital und print ) , eine Noten Buch (nur layouting und graphic design fehlt) und eine  Modenschau (Kimonos habe ich Prototyp gerade in Beginn der Produktion) .  Für alle Aufgaben ist noch zusätzliche Arbeit notwendig, die ich hoffte mit dem Geld des neuen Jobs vorzufinanzieren. Jetzt fehlt da ein ziemlich massives sicherheitsloch. Und ich habe Angst die Leute zu enttäuschen die bereits mit mir an den Teilstücken arbeiten. Mein Angst ist das diese glauben es wird niemals fertig. 

Und mein Problem ist, da dies so viele Dinge sind die zwar Teil meines gesamt Kunstwerkes sind aber auch fur viele    Menschen schwer als eine zusammengehörigen künstlerische Praxis erkennbar werden, wie schaffe ich es zum einen den künstlerischen kernprozess einzudampfen ist die Essenz die mir auf Dauer auch nicht immer so viel Geld kostet, und zweitens, ich Vermarktung in angemessenem Maße effektiv mitdenken kann. Den die ist leider heutzutage von den kuensterlinnen komplett selber mit zu tragen in den meisten Fällen. 

Persönlich habe ich sonst noch Sorgen mich zu verschulden oder weiter zu verschulden, oder auf den Touren wo ich glaube mit einiger Maßen bei Gebühriger Anzahl von Konzerten zumindest Miete zu zahlen. Leider ist meine Miete nicht mehr nur 200 Euro und ich kann auch nicht einfach kurzfristig unter vermieten oder meine Partnerin Paula für ein halbes Jahr Couch Surfen zurück lassen. Ich habe Angst vor einer schlecht geplanten Tour , die ich aber machen muss und will. Also nicht die schlecht geplante, sondern die gute Tour. 

Ich Zweifel gerade wieder so stark an dieser Kunst Sache da ja mein Plan ein Job bis Album fertig ist nebenher mir dann das finanzielle Polster gibt um ohne Sorge die Tour und das Release zu beginnen. Bei Förderungen gehe ich bisher seit Jahren immer leer aus. Meine Befürchtung, ich bin immer zu komplex und nicht konkret genug in meinen Konzepten . Aber in meiner Musik und mittlerweile auch in meinen Texten fühlt es sich trotzdem genau nach etwas an, nach einer Sprache. Nach einem Ausdruck der mir eigen ist. Ich habe extra meine Stimme noch trainiert um auch deutlicher Texte und Themen zu benennen. Relativ einfach Sätze, und Gefühle . In opulenten Klang Wolken. Predigend, verzweifelt predigend. Ein bisschen scheiternd und an dem gepredigten zerbrechen. Ich moechte dennoch nicht meine Kunst als Therapie verstehen. Sie ist ein. Ausdruck, und die Rolle hat zwar Ideen meiner eigenen Gefühls Welt, ist aber auch der Versuch eine universellere patriarchische Figur zu zeichnen, die es Schaft das zweifeln als Chance zu sehen. Und die glaubenswelt, des technokratischen, des religiösen, des machistischen , die sie umgibt mit neu Entdeckungen zu füllen und fühlen. 

Kann diese Suche bereits eine Praxis sein ? Wo finde ich die Kraft , auch ohne den finanziellen Erfolg diese Geschichte zu erzählen? Ohne dabei mich selbst zu verlieren oder krank zu machen. Ohne dabei meine Freundschaften aufs Spiel zu setzen, ohne finanziell beim Arbeitsamt zu landen oder in der Alters Armut. Wie schaffe ich es mich festzulegen und Pläne nicht ständig zu hinterfragen ? Um effizient zu sein. Um verstandenen zu werden. ps: ich schreibe sehr viel solche Texte auch über andere Themen traue mich aber nicht sie zu veröffentlichen, da ich mir nicht sicher sind ob sie relevant sind und ob ich der Ökonomie des online algo publizierens gewachsen bin. Ständig zu liefern. 

Das geht mir durch den Kopf. Deshalb bin ich unter anderem hier. Weiter Themen kommen noch auf , da bin ich mir sicher ;)
